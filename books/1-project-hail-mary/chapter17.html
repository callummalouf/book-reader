  <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
  <p>Iwake up with Rocky staring at me.
It happens every morning now. But it never stops being
creepy.
How do I know that a pentagonally symmetrical creature with
no eyes is “staring” at me? I just know. Something in the body
language.
“You awake,” he says.
“Yeah.” I step out of bed and stretch. “Food!”
The arms reach up and hand me a hot box. I open it up and
take a peek. Looks like eggs and sausage.
“Coffee.”
The arms dutifully hand me a cup of coffee. It’s kind of cool
that the arms will hand me a cup when there’s gravity, but a
pouch when there isn’t. I’ll remember this when writing up the
Hail Mary’s Yelp review.
I look to Rocky. “You don’t have to watch me sleep. It’s
okay.”
He turns his attention to a worktable in his partition of the
dormitory. “Eridian culture rule. Must watch.” He picks up a
device and tinkers with it.
Ah, the c-word. “Culture.” We have an unspoken agreement
that cultural things just have to be accepted. It ends any minor
dispute. “Do it my way because it’s how I was raised,” basically.
We haven’t run into anything where our cultures clash…yet.
I eat my breakfast and drink my coffee. Rocky doesn’t say
anything to me during that time. He never does. Eridian
courtesy.
“Trash,” I say.
The arms collect my empty cup and meal package.
I head up to the control room and settle into the pilot’s seat. I
bring up the telescope view on the main screen. Planet Adrian
sits in the center. I’ve been watching it grow larger and larger for
the past ten days. The closer we get, the more I respect Rocky’s
astronomy skills. All of his observations on its motion and mass
have been spot-on.
Hopefully his gravity calculation is right too. Or we’ll have a
very short and painful attempt to orbit.
Adrian is a pale-green planet with wispy white clouds in the
upper atmosphere. I can’t see the ground at all. Again, I’m
amazed at the software that must have gone into this ship’s
computers. We are spinning around as we hurtle through space.
But the image on-screen is rock solid.
“We’re getting close,” I say. Rocky is two floors below me,
but I speak at a normal volume. I know he can hear it just fine.
“You know air yet, question?” Rocky calls out. Just as I know
his hearing prowess, he knows my hearing limitations.
“I’ll try again right now,” I say.
I switch to the Spectrometer screen. The Hail Mary has been
incredibly reliable in almost every way, but you can’t expect
everything to work perfectly. The spectrometer has been acting
up. I think it has something to do with the digitizer. I’ve been
trying it every day, and it keeps saying it can’t get enough data
to analyze.
I zero in on Adrian and give it another go. The closer we get,
the more reflected light we’ll get, and maybe it’ll be enough for
the spectrometer to tell me what Adrian’s atmosphere is made
of.
…
…
…
 .
“It worked!” I say.
“Worked, question?!” Rocky says, a full octave higher than
normal. He scampers up his tunnels to the control-room bulb.
“What is Adrian air, question?”
I read the results off the screen. “Looks like it’s…91 percent
carbon dioxide, 7 percent methane, 1 percent argon, and the rest
are trace gases. It’s a pretty thick atmosphere too. Those are all
clear gases, but I can’t see the planet’s surface.”
“Normally you can see surface of planet from space,
question?”
“If the atmosphere lets light through, yes.”
“Human eyes are amazing organ. Jealous.”
“Well, not amazing enough. I can’t see Adrian’s surface.
When air gets really thick, it stops letting light through.
Anyway, that’s not important. The methane—that’s weird.”
“Explain.”
“Methane doesn’t last. It breaks apart very fast in sunlight. So
how is methane present?”
“Geology creates methane. Carbon dioxide plus minerals plus
water plus heat makes methane.”
“Yes. Possible,” I say. “But there’s a lot of methane. Eight
percent of a very thick atmosphere. Can geology make that
much?”
“You have different theory, question?”
I rub the back of my neck. “No. Not really. It is odd, though.”
“Discrepancy is science. You think about discrepancy. Make
theory. You is science human.”
“Yes. I’ll think about it.”
“How long until orbit, question?”
I switch to the Navigation console. We’re right on course, and
the orbital-insertion burn is scheduled for twenty-two hours
from now. “Just under one day,” I say.
“Excitement,” he says. “Then we sample Astrophage at Adrian.
You ship sampler working well, question?”
“Yes,” I say, with no way to know if I’m telling the truth.
There’s no reason for Rocky to know I only vaguely understand
the operation of my own ship.
I flip through the science instruments until I land on the
controls for the External Collection Unit. I look at the diagram
on the screen. It’s simple enough. The sampler is a rectangular
box. When activated, it will pivot up to be perpendicular to the
hull. Then, doors on both sides of the rectangle will open up.
Inside, there’s a bunch of sticky resin—ready to catch anything
that flies in.
That’s it. Flypaper. Fancy space flypaper, but just flypaper.
“After collection, how sample enter ship, question?”
Simple doesn’t mean convenient. As far as I can tell, there’s
no automated system to do anything with the sample. “I have to
go get it.”
“Humans are amaze. You leave ship.”
“Yeah, I guess.”
Eridians never bothered to invent spacesuits. Why would
they? Space is devoid of sensory input to them. It would be like
a human with scuba gear diving into an ocean of black paint.
There’s just no reason to do it. Eridians use hull robots for EVA
work. The Hail Mary doesn’t have one of those, so any EVA
work has to be done by me.
“Amaze is wrong word,” he says. “Amaze is compliment. Better
word is ♫♪♫♪.”
“What’s that mean?”
“It is when person not act normal. Danger to self.”
“Ah,” I say, adding the new chord into my language database.
“Crazy. My word for that is ‘crazy.’ ”
“Crazy. Humans are crazy.”
I shrug.
—
“Gosh darn it!” I said.
“Language!” came the voice over the radio. “Seriously,
though, what happened?”
The sample vial fell gently away from my hand to the bottom
of the pool. It took several seconds to fall 3 feet but, wearing
this EVA suit at the bottom of the world’s largest swimming
pool, I had no chance of reaching out to grab it.
“I dropped vial number three.”
“Okay,” said Forrester. “That’s three vials so far. We’re going
to have to work on the clamper tool.”
“Might not be the tool. Might just be me.”
The tool in my awkwardly gloved hand was far from perfect,
but still pretty ingenious. It turned the clumsy pawing of an
EVA suit glove into fine manipulation at the other end. All I had
to do was squeeze a trigger with my index finger and the clamp
constricted by 2 millimeters. If I squeezed a different trigger
with my middle finger, it would rotate up to 90 degrees
clockwise. My ring and pinkie fingers made it tilt forward up to
90 degrees.
“Stand by, I’m checking the video,” said Forrester.
NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab at Johnson Space Center was
a marvel of engineering in itself. The gigantic swimming pool
was large enough to fit a full-size replica of the International
Space Station inside. They used it to train astronauts on zero-g
maneuvering while in EVA suits.
After countless meetings (that I was unfortunately forced to
attend), the microbiology community convinced Stratt the
mission needed custom-designed tools. She agreed, on the
condition that none of them be mission-critical. She was
resolute on having all the important stuff be off-the-shelf
products with millions of hours of consumer testing.
And, being her little science lapdog, it fell to me to test out
the IVME kit.
IVME was an acronym that stood for four words God never
intended to be together: “in vacuo microbiology equipment.”
Astrophage lives in space. We could study them on Earth in our
atmosphere all we wanted, but we wouldn’t get the full picture
of how they worked until we studied them in vacuum and in
zero g. The crew of the Hail Mary would need these tools.
I stood in one corner of the NBL, the imposing figure of ISS
behind me. Two scuba divers floated nearby, ready to rescue me
in the event of an emergency.
NASA had sunk a metal lab table into the pool for me. The
biggest problem wasn’t making equipment that worked in
vacuum—though they did have to completely redesign pipettes
because there’s no suction force in space. The problem was the
ham-fisted EVA gloves the user had to wear. Astrophage may
like vacuum, but human bodies certainly don’t.
But hey, at least I was learning a lot about how Russian EVA
suits worked.
Yes, Russian. Not American. Stratt listened to several experts
and they all agreed the Russian Orlan EVA suit was the safest
and most reliable. So that’s what the mission would use.
“Okay, I see what happened,” said Forrester through the
headset. “You told the clamp to tilt yaw, but it released instead.
The internal microcable wires must be tangled up. I’ll be right
there. Can you surface and bring the clamp with you?”
“Sure thing.” I waved to the two divers and pointed upward.
They nodded and helped me to the surface.
I got hoisted out of the pool by a crane assembly and placed
on the deck nearby. Several techs came forward and helped me
out of the suit. Though it was pretty easy—I just stepped out the
back panel. Got to love chrysalis suits.
Forrester came from the control room next door and collected
the tool. “I’ll make some changes and we can try again in a
couple of hours. I got a call while you were in the pool; you’re
needed in Building 30. Shapiro and DuBois have a couple-hour
break while they reset the flight-control simulators. No rest for
the wicked. Stratt wants you over there training them on
Astrophage.”
“Copy that, Houston,” I said. The world might have been
ending, but being at NASA’s main campus was too awesome for
me not to be excited.
I left the NBL and walked to Building 30. They would have
sent a car if I’d asked, but I didn’t want one. It was only a tenminute walk. Besides, I loved walking around in my country’s
space history.
I walked in, through security, and onward to a small
conference room they’d set up. Martin DuBois, in his blue flight
uniform, stood and shook my hand. “Dr. Grace. Good to see
you again.”
His meticulous paperwork and notes were arrayed in front of
him. Annie Shapiro’s sloppy notes and wadded papers lay
strewn on the table next to him, but her seat was empty.
“Where’s Annie?” I asked.
He sat back down. Even while seated, he kept a firm, perfect
posture. “She had to use the facilities. She should be back
shortly.”
I sat down and opened my backpack. “You know, you can
call me Ryland. We’re all PhDs here. I think first names are
fine.”
“I’m sorry, Dr. Grace. That is not how I was raised. However,
you may call me Martin if you wish.”
“Thanks.” I pulled out my laptop and fired it up. “How have
you been lately?”
“I have been well, thank you. Dr. Shapiro and I have begun a
sexual relationship.”
I paused. “Um. Okay.”
“I thought it prudent to inform you.” He opened his notebook
and set a pen beside it. “There should be no secrets within the
core mission group.”
“Sure, sure,” I said. “I mean. It shouldn’t be a problem.
You’re the primary science position and Annie’s the alternate.
There’s no scenario where you would both be on the mission.
But…I mean…your relationship…”
“Yes, you are correct,” DuBois said. “I will be setting out on a
suicide mission in under a year. And if for some reason I am
deemed unfit or unable, she will go on the suicide mission. We
are aware of this, and we know this relationship can only end in
death.”
“We live in bleak times,” I said.
He folded his hands in front of him. “Dr. Shapiro and I do
not see it that way. We are enjoying very active sexual
encounters.”
“Yeah, okay, I don’t need to know—”
“No need for condoms either. She is on birth control and we
have both had extremely thorough medical examinations as part
of the program.”
I typed on my computer, hoping he’d change the subject.
“It’s quite pleasurable.”
“I’m sure it is.”
“In any event, I thought you should know.”
“Yeah, no, sure.”
The door opened, and Annie trotted in.
“Sorry! Sorry! I had to pee. Like…so bad,” said the world’s
smartest and most accomplished microbiologist. “My back teeth
were floating!”
“Welcome back, Dr. Shapiro. I’ve told Dr. Grace about our
sexual relationship.”
I put my head in my hands.
“Cool,” said Annie. “Yeah, we’ve got nothing to hide.”
“In any event,” said DuBois, “if I remember the previous
lesson correctly, we were working on the cellular biology within
Astrophage mitochondria.”
I cleared my throat. “Yes. Today I’ll be talking about the
Astrophage’s Krebs cycle. It’s identical to what we find in Earth
mitochondria, but with one additional step—”
Annie held up her hand. “Oh, sorry. One more thing—” She
turned to DuBois. “Martin, we have about fifteen minutes of
personal time after this lesson and before our next training
exercise. Want to meet up in the bathroom down the hall and
have sex?”
“I find that agreeable,” said DuBois. “Thank you, Dr.
Shapiro.”
“Okay, cool.”
They both looked to me, ready for their lesson. I waited a few
seconds to make sure there was no more oversharing, but they
seemed content. “Okay, so the Krebs cycle in Astrophage has a
variant—wait. Do you call her Dr. Shapiro while having sex?”
“Of course. That’s her name.”
“I kind of like it,” she said.
“I’m sorry I asked,” I said. “Now, the Krebs cycle…”
—
Rocky’s data about Planet Adrian was dead-on. It’s 3.93 times
Earth’s mass and has a radius of 10,318 kilometers (almost
double Earth’s). It’s plugging along around Tau Ceti with an
average orbital velocity of 35.9 kilometers per second. Plus, he
had the position of the planet correct to within 0.00001 percent.
That data was all I needed to work out the insertion thrust
needed.
It’s a good thing those numbers were right. If they hadn’t
been, there would have been some serious scrambling when the
orbital insertion went wrong. Maybe even some dying.
Of course, to use the spin drives at all, I had to take us out of
centrifuge mode.
Rocky and I float in the control room, he in his ceiling bulb
and me in the pilot’s seat. I watch the camera-feed screen with a
stupid grin on my face.
I’m at another planet! I shouldn’t be this excited. I’ve been at
another star for the past several weeks. But that’s kind of
esoteric. Tau Ceti is pretty much like the sun. It’s bright, you
can’t get too close to it, and it even emits the same general range
of frequencies. For some reason, being at a new planet is much
more exciting.
The wispy clouds of Adrian coast by beneath us. Or, more
accurately, the wispy clouds barely move at all and we zoom by
overhead. Adrian has a higher gravity than Earth, so our orbital
velocity is just over 12 kilometers per second—far more than
what’s needed to orbit Earth.
The pale-green planet that I’ve been watching for eleven days
has a lot more detail now that we’re on top of it. It’s not just
green. There are dark and light bands of green wrapping around
it. Just like Jupiter and Saturn. But unlike those two gas-giant
leviathans, Adrian is a rocky world. Thanks to Rocky’s notes,
we know the radius and mass, which means we know its density.
And it’s far too dense to be just gas. There’s a surface down
there, I just can’t see it.
Man, what I wouldn’t give for a lander!
Realistically, it wouldn’t do me any good. Even if I had some
way of landing on Adrian, the atmosphere would crush me dead.
It’d be like landing on Venus. Or Erid, for that matter. Heck, in
that case, I wish Rocky had a lander. The pressure down there
might not be too much for an Eridian.
Speaking of Erid, Rocky’s calibrating some kind of device in
his control-room bubble. It looks almost like a gun. I don’t think
we’ve started a space war, so I assume it’s something else.
He holds the device with one hand, taps it with another, and
uses two more to hold a rectangular panel that is connected to
the device by a short cable. He uses his remaining hand to
anchor himself at a handhold.
He makes some more adjustments to the device with what
looks like a screwdriver, and suddenly the panel springs to life.
It was completely flat, but now has a texture to it. He waves the
gun part left and right and the patterns on the screen move left
and right.
“Success! It functions!”
I lean over the edge of the pilot’s seat for a better look.
“What’s that?”
“Wait.” He points the gun part at my external camera readout
screen. He adjusts a couple of controls and the pattern on the
rectangle settles into a circle. Looking closer, I see some parts
of the circle are a little more raised than others. It looks like a
relief map.
“This device hear light. Like human eye.”
“Oh. It’s a camera.”
“ ♫ ♪ ♫ ,” he says quickly. Now we have “camera” in our
vocabulary.
“It analyze light and show as texture.”
“Oh, and you can sense that texture?” I say. “Cool.”
“Thank.” He attaches the camera to the bulb wall and fixes its
angle to point at my central screen. “What are wavelengths of
light humans can see, question?”
“All wavelengths between 380 nanometers and 740
nanometers.” Most people don’t just know that off the top of
their head. But most people aren’t junior high schoolteachers
who have giant charts of the visible spectrum on their classroom
walls.
“Understand,” he says. He turns a few knobs on his device.
“Now I ‘see’ what you see.”
“You’re an amazing engineer.”
He waves a claw dismissively. “No. Camera is old technology.
Display is old technology. Both were on my ship for science. I
only modify to use inside.”
I think Eridians have a lot of modesty in their culture. Either
that, or Rocky is one of those people who just can’t take a
compliment.
He points to the circle on his display. “This is Adrian,
question?”
I check the exact region of Adrian he’s pointing at, then
compare to my screen. “Yes, and that part is ‘green.’ ”
“I not have word for this.”
Of course the Eridian language has no words for colors. Why
would it? I never thought of colors as a mysterious thing. But if
you’ve never heard of them before, I guess they’re pretty weird.
We have names for frequency ranges in the electromagnetic
spectrum. Then again, my students all have eyes and they were
still amazed when I told them “x-rays,” “microwaves,” “Wi-Fi,”
and “purple” were all just wavelengths of light.
“You name it then,” I say.
“Yes yes. I name this color: middle-rough. My display pattern
is smooth for high-frequency light. Rough for low-frequency
light. This color is middle-rough.”
“Understand,” I say. “And yes, green is right in the middle of
the wavelengths humans can see.”
“Good good,” he says. “Is sample ready, question?”
We’ve been in orbit for about a day now and I activated the
sampler right when we got here. I flip to the External Collection
Unit screen. It reads as fully functional and even reports how
long it’s been open: 21 hours and 17 minutes.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“You get.”
“Ugh,” I groan. “EVAs are so much work!”
“Lazy human. Go get!”
I laugh. He has a slightly different tone when he’s joking
around. It took a long time for me to identify. It’s like…it’s in
the timing between words. They don’t have the same cadence. I
can’t really put my finger on it, but I know when I hear it.
From the External Collection Unit screen, I order the sampler
to close its doors and return to its flat configuration. The panel
reports that it’s been done, and I confirm it with hull cameras.
I climb into the Orlan EVA suit, enter the airlock, and cycle
it.
Adrian is absolutely gorgeous in person. I stay out on the hull
staring at the huge world for several minutes. Bands of dark and
light green cover the orb, and the reflected glow from Tau Ceti
is simply breathtaking. I could stare at it for hours.
I probably got to do this with Earth too. I wish I could
remember. Man, I really wish I could remember that. It must
have been every bit as beautiful.
“You out long time,” comes Rocky’s voice through the headset.
“You are safe, question?”
I set up the EVA panel to always play my radio feed over
speakers in the control room. Plus, I taped a headset
microphone to Rocky’s control-room bulb and set it to be voiceactivated. All he has to do is talk and it broadcasts.
“I’m looking at Adrian. It’s pretty.”
“Look later. Get sample now.”
“You’re pushy.”
“Yes.”
I climb along the hull, bathed in Adrian-light. Everything has
a light-green tinge to it. I find the sample collector right where
it’s supposed to be.
It’s not as big as I expected. It’s a half-meter square or so.
There’s a lever beside it with red and yellow stripes all around it.
Text on the lever reads     —ПОТЯНУТЬ
РЫЧАГ ЧТОБЫ ОСВОБОДИТЬ ECU—拉杆释放.
I clip a tether to a convenient hole on the unit (presumably
put there for this exact use), and pull the lever over to the open
position.
The sampler floats free of the hull.
I work my way back across the hull to the airlock with the
sampler in tow. I cycle my way back in and climb out of the
suit.
“All is good, question?” Rocky asks.
“Yes.”
“Good!” Rocky says. “You inspect with science gear, question?”
“Yes. Now.” I bring up the Centrifuge panel. “Prepare for
gravity.”
“Yes, gravity.” He grips handholds with three of his claws.
“For science gear.”
Once the centrifuge spins up, I get to work in the lab.
Rocky scurries into his tunnel in the lab ceiling and watches
intently. Well, not “watches.” Listens intently, I guess.
I lay the sampler on the lab table and open one of the panels.
This is the side that faced Tau Ceti. I smile at what I see.
I crane my head to look up at Rocky. “This panel was white
when we started; now it’s black.”
“Not understand.”
“The sampler’s color changed to the color of Astrophage. We
got a lot of Astrophage.”
“Good good!”
Over the next two hours, I scrape everything off of both
halves of the sampler, putting each group in their own
containers. Then I give each sample a good rinse with water and
let the Astrophage settle to the bottom. I’m sure a lot of that
sticky substance came with the Astrophage when I scraped it
off, and I want it gone.
I perform a series of tests. First I run a few Astrophage
through DNA-marker testing to see if they are identical to the
Astrophage found at Earth. They are—at least, the markers I
checked are identical.
Then I check overall population of each sample.
“Interesting,” I say.
Rocky perks up. “What is interesting, question?”
“Both halves had approximately the same population.”
“Not expected,” he says.
“Not expected,” I agree.
One side of the sampler pointed toward Tau Ceti, while the
other pointed toward Adrian. Astrophage migrate to breed. For
every frisky Astrophage that heads to Adrian with a twinkle in
its eye, two should return. So, broadly speaking, there should be
twice as many Astrophage going from Adrian to Tau Ceti as
there are going the other direction. But that’s not what’s
happening. The outgoing population is the same as the incoming
population.
Rocky climbs along the tunnel that runs across the roof of the
lab to get a better look. “Flaw in counting, question? How you
count, question?”
“I measure total heat energy output of both samples.” It’s a
surefire way to know how much Astrophage you’re dealing with.
Each one insists on being 96.415 degrees Celsius. The more of
them there are, the more total heat will be absorbed by the
metal plate I put them on.
He taps two claws together. “That is good method. Population
must be same. How, question?”
“I don’t know.” I smear some of the “returning” Astrophage
(that is, the Astrophage that was on the way from Adrian to Tau
Ceti) onto a slide. I take it to a microscope.
Rocky scampers along his tunnel to keep up. “That is what,
question?”
“Microscope,” I say. “It helps me see very small things. I can
see Astrophage with this.”
“Amaze.”
I take a look at the sample and gasp. There’s a lot more than
just Astrophage in there!
The familiar black dots of Astrophage are all over the sample.
But so are translucent cells, smaller bacteria-looking things, and
larger amoeba-like things. There are thin things, fat things,
spiral things…too many to count. Too many different kinds of
things to count. It’s like looking at all the life in a drop of lake
water!
“Wow!” I say. “Life! There’s a whole bunch of life in here!
Not just Astrophage. A bunch of different species!”
Rocky literally bounces off the tunnel walls. “Amaze! Amaze
amaze amaze!”
“Adrian isn’t just a planet,” I say. “Adrian is a planet with life,
like Earth or Erid! That explains where the methane comes
from. Life makes methane!”
Rocky freezes. Then he shoots bolt-upright. I’ve never seen
him raise his carapace so high. “Life is also reason for
population discrepancy! Life is reason!”
“What?” I say. He’s more excited than I’ve ever seen him.
“How? I don’t understand.”
He taps the tunnel wall with his claw, pointing at my
microscope. “Some life on Adrian EATS Astrophage! Population
in balance. Natural order. This explains all things!”
“Oh my God!” I gasp. My heart just about beats out of my
chest. “Astrophage has a predator!”
There’s a whole biosphere at Adrian. Not just Astrophage.
There’s even an active biosphere within the Petrova line.
This is where it all started. Has to be. How else can we
explain countless extremely different life-forms that all evolved
to migrate in space? They all came from the same genetic root.
Astrophage was just one of many, many life-forms that
evolved here. And with all life, there is variance and predation.
Adrian isn’t just some planet that Astrophage infected. It’s the
Astrophage homeworld! And it’s the home of Astrophage’s
predators.
“This is amazing!” I yell. “If we find a predator…”
“We take home!” Rocky says, two octaves higher than normal.
“It eat Astrophage, breed, eat more Astrophage, breed, eat more
more more! Stars saved!”
“Yes!” I press my knuckles against the tunnel wall. “Fistbump!”
“What, question?”
I rap the tunnel again. “This. Do this.”
He emulates my gesture against the wall opposite my hand.
“Celebration!” I say.
“Celebration!”</p>
