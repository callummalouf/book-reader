  <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
  <p>Ileap from the stool, but I don’t have a plan.
“Okay, don’t panic,” I tell myself. “Think clearly. Then act.”
The BOCOA is still hot. That means there’s a lot of living
Astrophage still in there. I caught it early. That’s good. Not
because of the BOCOA—it’s toast. I’ll never be able to sort out
the Taumoeba from the Astrophage in there. But it means that
however the heck the Taumoeba got in there, this is very recent
and hopefully hasn’t reached the ship’s fuel.
Yes. That’s priority number one. Don’t let Taumoeba into the
fuel bays. Last time they got in was because of various
microscopic leaks in the system. But it had to have gotten there
from the crew compartments where I had brought it aboard.
There isn’t much overlap between the fuel system and the crew
compartment. There’s just one place that’s the likely culprit for
transfer.
Life support.
If the ship is too cold, it runs air across coils filled with
Astrophage to warm it up. A breach in one of those coils would
do it. Lucky for me I’ve had a big pile of 96°C Astrophage in
the lab keeping the crew compartment so warm the ship has to
use the air-conditioning system.
Okay, now I have a plan.
I scamper up the ladder to the control room. I bring up the
Life Support panel and look at the logs. As I suspected, the
heater hasn’t been turned on in over a month. I deactivate the
heater entirely. It shows as disabled, but I don’t trust it.
I go to the primary breaker box. It’s under the pilot’s seat. I
find the breaker for the heating system and flick it off.
“Okay,” I say.
I get back in the seat and check the Fuel panel. The fuel bays
all seem to be in good shape. The temperature is correct. It
wouldn’t take long for Taumoeba to run wild and eat everything
in a fuel bay—I know that for darn certain. If they were
affected, they’d be colder than that.
I bring up the spin-drive controls and shut the engines off.
The floor drops out from under me as I return to weightlessness.
I probably don’t need to shut them off, but for now I don’t want
the fuel doing anything. If there’s Taumoeba in a fuel line, I
want it to stay there, not get pumped all over the ship.
“Okay…” I say again. “Okay…”
More thinking.
How did it get loose? I sterilized every part of this ship with
nitrogen before getting a gram of Astrophage from Rocky. The
only Taumoeba aboard are in the sealed mini-farms on the
beetles and the sealed, xenonite breeder tanks.
No. No time for science questions. I can speculate on the
cause later. Right now I have an engineering problem. I wish
Rocky were here.
I always wish Rocky were here.
“Nitrogen,” I say.
I don’t know how the Taumoeba got out, but I need them
dead. Taumoeba-82.5 can handle 8.25 percent nitrogen at 0.02
atmospheres. Maybe a little higher. But it definitely can’t handle
100 percent nitrogen at the crew compartment’s 0.33
atmospheres. That works out to be two hundred times its lethal
dose of nitrogen.
I float to the breaker box and shut off everything related to
life support. Immediately, the emergency alarm sounds and red
lights turn on. I kick across the control room to the emergency
system’s breaker box and shut those all off as well.
The master alarm is annoying, so I silence it on the main
interface panel.
I fly down to the lab and throw open my gas cylinder supply
cupboard. I have about 10 kilograms of nitrogen gas in a single
canister. Again, I owe my life to DuBois’s preferred method of
suicide.
I don’t remember all the details about the life-support system,
but I know it has manual overpressure valves. The ship simply
will not allow more than 0.33 atmospheres. If all else fails
(which it will, because I shut the emergency systems down), it’ll
vent excess pressure into space.
I can’t just release the nitrogen and hope for the best. I want
to get rid of the existing oxygen first. I’m through messing
around with this stuff. I want 100 percent nitrogen in here. I
want to make this ship so utterly toxic to Taumoeba that it has
no chance of survival. Even if it’s hiding under some goop
somewhere—I want the nitrogen to suffuse through it. Nitrogen
everywhere. Everywhere!
I grab the nitrogen cylinder, kick off the floor, and float back
up to the control room. I throw open the airlock inner door and
get into the Orlan suit faster than I ever have in the past. I boot
everything up and don’t even bother with the self-check. No
time.
I leave the inner airlock door open and turn the manual
emergency valve on the outer door. The ship’s air hisses away
into space. The primary and emergency life-support systems are
powered down. They are unable to replace the lost gas.
Now I wait.
—
It takes a surprisingly long time for a ship to lose all its air. In
movies, if there’s a little breach everyone dies immediately. Or
the muscular hero guy plugs the hole with his biceps or
something. But in real life, air just doesn’t move that fast.
The emergency valve on the airlock is 4 centimeters across.
Seems like a pretty big hole to have in your spaceship, right?
It took twenty minutes for the ship’s air pressure to drop to 10
percent of its original value. And it’s dropping very slowly now.
I think it’s a logarithmic function. So in the middle of this
emergency, I just have to stand here with my tank in my hand.
“Okay. Ten percent is close enough,” I say. I close the airlock
emergency valve to reseal the ship. Then I open the nitrogen
tank.
So now, instead of listening to a hiss from the airlock, I listen
to a hiss from the nitrogen tank.
Not much difference there.
Again. It’s a bit of a wait. But not as long this time. Probably
because the pressure inside that nitrogen tank was a lot higher
than the pressure in the ship. Whatever. Point is, in short order
the ship is back to 0.33 atmospheres of pressure. But it’s almost
entirely nitrogen.
Funny thing—I’d be perfectly comfortable if I took this EVA
suit off. I’d breathe without any problems. Right up until I died.
There’s nowhere near enough oxygen for me to survive.
I want that nitrogen to permeate everything it can. I want it to
get into every crevice. Wherever Taumoeba are lurking, I want
them found and killed. Go forth, my N2 minions, and cause
destruction!
I head down to the lab and check out the BOCOA. I left in
such a hurry I forgot to seal the vat. Fortunately, Astrophage is
gunky stuff. Surface tension and inertia kept it inside. I close the
lid and bring it up to the airlock. I jettison the whole thing.
I probably could have saved the surviving Astrophage in the
vat. I could have bubbled nitrogen through the sludge to make
sure it gets at all the little Taumoeba lurking inside. But why
take the chance? I have over 2 million kilograms of Astrophage.
There’s no point in risking the whole mission just to save a few
hundred.
I wait three hours. Then I flick the breakers back on. After a
period of initial panic, the life-support system gets the air back
to normal thanks to the ship’s copious oxygen reserves.
I have to isolate every source of Taumoeba on this ship.
Preferably before the life-support system finishes pumping out
the nitrogen. Why not do it before getting back to normal air?
Because it’ll be a lot easier and faster without wearing the EVA
suit. I need my hands to do this, not my hands inside bulky
gloves.
I climb out of the Orlan and fly down to the lab, the nitrogen
cylinder in hand.
First up: the breeder farms.
I put each of the ten farms in large plastic bins. I install a little
valve on each bin (epoxy can do anything), and pump in
nitrogen. If any of the farms have a leak, the nitrogen will get in
and kill everything. Any farm that’s behaving properly—
keeping airtight—won’t have any problems.
The bins are airtight to begin with, but I seal them with duct
tape anyway, and I deliberately overpressurize them by just a
little bit. The sides and tops bulge out. Now if any of the farms
leak, it’ll be visually apparent because the bulging will
disappear.
Next up: the beetles and their mini-farms.
John and Paul already have their mini-farms installed. I put
them in isolation bins just like I did with the breeder farms. I
was working on Ringo when the poop hit the fan, so that minifarm and the one intended for George are still uninstalled. I put
the pair together in another isolation bin.
I tape everything to the walls. I don’t want any of the bins to
float around. They might bump into something sharp.
The lab is a shambles. I was halfway through disassembling
Ringo when I shut off the spin drives. Tools, beetle parts, and all
manner of other junk floats around the room. I’ll have to clean
all that up without the aid of gravity before I can even take a
break.
“Well, this sucks,” I mumble.</p>
