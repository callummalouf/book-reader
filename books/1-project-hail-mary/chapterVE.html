  <h1>Chapter VE</h1>
  <p>I finish off the last bite of my meburger and gulp down the
vitamin-enriched soda. I put my dishes in the sink and check the
clock on my kitchen wall. Wow, is it Vℓ Iλλ already? I better
hurry up.
My first few years on Erid were touch-and-go. Taumoeba
kept me alive, but I became severely malnourished. The
microbes gave me calories, but they weren’t a balanced diet.
Those were painful days. I had scurvy, beriberi, and a raft of
other maladies. Was it worth it? I still don’t know. I might never
know. There’s no way to communicate with Earth. It’s sixteen
light-years away.
For all I know, the beetles may have malfunctioned or missed
their target. I don’t even know if the climatologists like Leclerc
were right in their models for what would happen. The Hail
Mary might have been hopeless from the get-go. Earth might
already be a frozen wasteland with billions of corpses.
But I try to stay positive. What else have I got?
For what it’s worth, the Eridians are fantastic hosts. They
don’t have a government, per se, but all the important entities
agreed to do whatever it takes to keep me alive. After all, I
played a critical role in saving their planet. And even if I hadn’t,
I’m a living, breathing alien. Of course they’re going to keep me
alive. I’m of extreme scientific interest.
I live in a big dome in the middle of one of their “cities.”
Though “city” isn’t quite the right word. A better description
might be a “cluster.”
I have grounds and everything. Thirty Eridians outside the
dome maintain my life-support systems, or so I’m told. And my
dome is very close to one of the larger science centers. Many of
Erid’s greatest minds collect there and thrum. That’s sort of a
song and discussion in one. But everyone talks at the same time
and it’s not really conscious on their part. Somehow the thrum
leads to conclusions and decisions. The thrum itself is much
smarter than any Eridian in it. In a way, Eridians can become
ad-hoc neurons in a group mind. But they come and go as they
please.
I’m particularly interesting, so pretty much every scientist on
the planet came together to thrum up ways to keep me alive. I’m
told it was the second-largest science-oriented thrum ever
executed. (The largest, of course, was when they had to make a
plan for dealing with Astrophage.)
Thanks to my Earth scientific journals, they know all my
nutritional needs and how to synthesize the various vitamins in
labs. Once they solved that, smaller, less-focused groups worked
on making them taste better. That’s more or less up to me,
actually. Lots of taste tests. Glucose, common to both Eridian
and Human biomes, comes up a lot.
The best thing, though, is they managed to clone my muscle
tissue and grow it in labs. I can thank Earth science for that.
They were nowhere near that technology when I first showed up.
But that was sixteen years ago—they’re catching up quite well.
Anyway, it means I can finally eat meat. Yes, that’s right, I’m
eating human meat. But it’s my own meat, and I don’t feel bad
about it. Spend a decade eating nothing but odd-tasting, vaguely
sweet vitamin shakes and then see if you’ll turn down a burger.
I love meburgers. I eat one every day.
I grab my cane and head out. I’m not a young man anymore,
and the high gravity of Erid has only made my bones degenerate
faster. I think I’m fifty-three years old now, but I’m not sure.
I’ve done a lot of time-dilated travel. I can accurately say
seventy-one years have gone by on Earth since I was born, for
what it’s worth.
I leave through my front door and cross the grounds. There
are no plants or anything—I’m the only thing on this planet that
can survive my environment. But there are some very tasteful
and aesthetically pleasing rocks. It’s become a hobby of mine:
making the grounds as pretty as possible. The Eridians just see
a bunch of rocks, but I see all the colors.
They installed lights at the top of the dome that get brighter
and dimmer on a twenty-four-hour cycle. I explained that’s
critical to my mood and they took my word for it. Though I did
have to explain to this species of interstellar travelers how to
make lightbulbs.
I make my way along the gravel pathway to one of the many
“meeting” rooms at the dome’s wall. Eridians value face-tocarapace communication as much as humans do, and this is a
good compromise. My side is within my bubble environment.
And on the other side of the 1-centimeter clear xenonite is a
room that’s out in Erid’s natural atmosphere.
I hobble in. It’s one of the smaller meeting rooms, really only
suitable for a one-on-one conversation. But it’s become our goto spot for meeting up.
Rocky waits for me on the Eridian side. “Finally! I’ve been
waiting for ℓλ minutes! What took you so long?!”
I can understand Eridian fluently now, of course. And Rocky
is equally fluent in English comprehension.
“I’m old. Give me a break. It takes me a while to get ready in
the morning.”
“Oh, you had to eat, right?” Rocky says, a tinge of disgust in
his voice.
“You told me not to talk about that in polite company.”
“I’m not polite company, my friend!”
I snicker. “So what’s up?”
He wiggles and jiggles. I’ve almost never seen him this
excited. “I just heard from the Astronomy hive. They have news!”
I hold my breath. “Sol? Is it about Sol?!”
“Yes!” he squeals. “Your star has returned to full luminance!”
I gasp. “Are you sure? Like, Iℓℓ percent certainty?”
“Yes. The data was analyzed by a thrum of λV astronomers. It
checks out.”
I can’t move. I can barely breathe. I start to tremble.
It’s over.
We won.
Simple as that.
Sol—Earth’s sun—has returned to its pre-Astrophage
brightness. There’s only one possible way that happens:
Astrophage is gone. Or at least reduced in population so much
that it doesn’t matter.
We won.
We did it!
Rocky cocks his carapace. “Hey, your face is leaking! I
haven’t seen that in a long-ass time! Remind me—does that mean
you’re happy or sad? ’Cause it can mean either one, right?”
“I’m happy, of course!” I sob.
“Yeah, I thought so. Just checking.” He holds a balled claw
against the xenonite. “Is this a fist-bump situation?”
I press my knuckles to the xenonite as well. “This is a
monumentally epic fist-bump situation.”
“I guess your scientists got right on it,” he says. “If you account
for the time it took your beetles to get there and the travel time for
light to get from Sol to Erid…I think it took less than one of your
years to get it done.”
I nod. It’s still sinking in.
“So will you go home now? Or will you stay?”
The…entities…that make major decisions for Erid long ago
offered to refuel the Hail Mary. It’s still sitting in a nice, stable
orbit around Erid, where it’s been since Rocky and I first arrived
all those years ago.
The Eridians could stock it up with food and supplies, help
me make sure everything is working right, and send me on my
way. But so far I haven’t taken them up on it. It’s a long, lonely
journey, and until a minute ago I didn’t even know if Earth was
still habitable. Erid may not be where I’m from, but at least I
have friends here.
“I…I don’t know. I’m getting old and the trip is long.”
“Speaking from a selfish perspective, I hope you stay. But that’s
just me.”
“Rocky…that news about Sol…it…it makes my whole life
have meaning. You know? I still can’t…I can’t…” I start
sobbing again.
“Yeah, I know. That’s why I wanted to be the one to tell you.”
I check my watch. (Yes, the Eridians made me a wristwatch.
They make anything I ask for. I try not to abuse it.) “I have to
go. I’m late. But…Rocky…”
“I know,” he says, tilting his carapace in what I’ve come to
realize is a smile. “I know. We’ll talk more about it later. I have
to get home anyway. Adrian is going to sleep soon, so I have to be
there to watch.”
We both head toward our respective exits, but he pauses.
“Hey, Grace. Do you ever wonder? About other life out there?”
I lean on my cane. “Sure, all the time.”
He walks back in. “I keep thinking about it. The theories are
pretty hard to dispute. Some ancestor of Astrophage seeded Earth
and Erid with life billions of years ago.”
“Yeah,” I say. “And I know where you’re going with this.”
“Do you?”
“Yeah.” I shift my weight from one leg to the other. Arthritis
is starting to settle in my joints. High gravity isn’t great for
humans. “There are fewer than fifty stars as close to Tau Ceti as
we are. But two of them ended up with life. It means life—at
least, the life Tau Ceti puts out—might be a lot more common
in our galaxy than we think.”
“Think we’ll find more of them? Intelligent species?”
“Who knows?” I say. “You and I found each other. That’s
something.”
“Yeah,” he says. “It really is something. Go do your job, old
man.”
“Later, Rocky.”
“Later!”
I hobble out of the room and make my way along the
perimeter of the dome. They made the whole thing out of clear
xenonite because they thought that’s what I would want. But it
doesn’t matter. It’s pitch-dark outside all the time. Sure, I can
shine a flashlight out there and occasionally see an Eridian going
about his business. But I don’t get sweeping vistas of mountains
or anything. Just inky blackness.
My smile fades a little.
How bad did it get back on Earth? Did they work together to
survive? Or did millions die in wars and famine?
They were able to collect the beetles, read my information,
and implement a solution. A solution that would have involved a
probe going to Venus. So there’s definitely some advanced
infrastructure still there.
I bet they did work together. Maybe it’s just the childish
optimist in me, but humanity can be pretty impressive when we
put our minds to it. After all, everyone worked together to build
the Hail Mary. That was no easy feat.
I hold my head up high. Maybe I will go home someday.
Maybe I’ll find out for sure.
But not right now. Right now, I’ve got work to do.
I continue along the path to the large double doors leading to
another meeting space. And I have to say, it’s my favorite one.
I step into the chamber. About one-fifth of the room is my
Earth environment. The other side of the divider wall has thirty
little Eridians bouncing around like idiots. Each one is no more
than thirty Earth years old. The selection process for which ones
get to attend…well…again, Eridian culture is complicated.
An Earthlike organ keyboard sits in the center of my area,
oriented such that the operator faces the kids. The organ has
quite a few more options than a typical keyboard found on
Earth. I can apply inflection, tone, mood, and all the other little
intricacies of spoken language. I settle into the comfortable
chair, crack my knuckles, and start the class.
“All right, all right,” I play. “Everyone settle down and get in
your seats.”
They scamper to their assigned desks and sit quietly, ready for
the lesson to begin.
“Who here can tell me the speed of light?”
Twelve kids raise their claws.</p>
