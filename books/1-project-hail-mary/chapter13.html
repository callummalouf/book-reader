  <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
  <p>“Mr. Easton, I don’t think we need to be
searched,” said Stratt.
“I think you do,” said the head prison guard. His thick New
Zealand accent sounded friendly, but there was an edge to it.
This man had made a whole career out of not putting up with
people’s crap.
“We’re exempt from all—”
“Stop,” Easton said. “No one gets in or out of Pare without a
full search.”
Auckland Prison, which the locals called “Pare” for some
reason, was New Zealand’s only maximum-security prison unit.
The sole point of entry was awash with security cameras and a
micro-scanner for all guests. Even the guards passed through the
detector on their way in.
Easton’s assistant and I stood off to the side while our bosses
had their dispute. He and I looked at each other and mutually
shrugged. A small fraternity of underlings with stubborn bosses.
“I’m not turning over my Taser. I can call your prime minister
if you like,” Stratt said.
“Sure,” said Easton. “She’ll tell you the same thing I’m about
to tell you now: We don’t let weapons anywhere near those
animals in there. Even my own guards only have batons. There
are some rules we don’t change. I’m fully aware of your
authority, but it has limits. You’re not magical.”
“Mr. E—”
“Torch!” Easton said, holding out his hand.
His assistant handed over a small flashlight. He clicked it on.
“Please open your mouth wide, Ms. Stratt. I need to check for
contraband.”
Whoa boy. I stepped forward before this got any worse. “I’ll
go first!” I opened my mouth wide.
Easton shined the light into my mouth and looked this way
and that. “You’re clear.”
Stratt just glared at him.
He held the flashlight at the ready. “I can get a female guard
in here and order a much more thorough search if you like.”
For a few seconds, she did nothing. Then she pulled her Taser
from its holster and handed it over.
She must have been tired. I’d never seen her give up on a
power trip before. Though, I also hadn’t seen her get into a
useless peeing contest before either. She had a lot of authority
and wasn’t afraid to flex when needed, but she usually wasn’t
one to argue when a simple solution was present.
Soon, guards escorted Stratt and me through the cold, gray
walls of the prison.
“What the heck is wrong with you?” I said.
“I don’t like little dictators in their little kingdoms,” she said.
“Drives me crazy.”
“You can bend a little once in a while.”
“I’m out of patience and the world is out of time.”
I held up a finger. “No, no, no! You can’t just use ‘I’m saving
the world’ as an excuse every time you’re a jerk.”
She thought it over. “Yeah, okay. You may have a point.”
We followed the guards down a long corridor to the
Maximum Security Unit.
“Maximum security seems like overkill,” she said.
“Seven people died,” I reminded her. “Because of him.”
“It was accidental.”
“It was criminal negligence. He deserves what he got.”
The guards led us around a corner. We followed along. The
whole place was a maze.
“Why bring me here at all?”
“Science.”
“As always.” I sighed. “Can’t say I like this.”
“Noted.”
We entered a stark room containing a single metal table. On
one side sat a prisoner in a bright-orange jumpsuit. A balding
man in his late forties, maybe early fifties. He was handcuffed to
the table. He didn’t look anything like a threat.
Stratt and I sat down opposite him. The guards closed the
door behind us.
The man looked at us. He tilted his head slightly, waiting for
someone to speak.
“Dr. Robert Redell,” Stratt said.
“Call me Bob,” he said.
“I’ll call you Dr. Redell.” She pulled a file out of her briefcase
and looked it over. “You’re currently serving a life sentence for
seven counts of culpable homicide.”
“That’s their excuse for me being here, yes,” he said.
I piped up. “Seven people died on your rig. Because of your
negligence. Seems like a pretty good ‘excuse’ for you to be
here.”
He shook his head. “Seven people died because the control
room didn’t follow procedure and activated a primary pumping
station while workers were still in the reflector tower. It was a
horrible accident, but it was an accident.”
“Enlighten us, then,” I said. “If the deaths at your solar farm
weren’t your fault, why are you here?”
“Because the government thinks I embezzled millions of
dollars.”
“And why do they think that?” I asked.
“Because I embezzled millions of dollars.” He adjusted his
shackled wrists into a more comfortable position. “But that had
nothing to do with the deaths. Nothing!”
“Tell me about your blackpanel power idea,” Stratt said.
“Blackpanel?” He drew back. “It was just an idea. I emailed
that anonymously.”
Stratt rolled her eyes. “Do you really think email sent from a
prison computer lab is anonymous?”
He looked away. “I’m not a computer guy. I’m an engineer.”
“I want to hear more about blackpanel,” she said. “And if I
like what I hear, it could reduce your jail time. So start talking.”
He perked up. “Well…I mean…okay. What do you know
about solar thermal power?”
Stratt looked at me.
“Uh,” I said. “It’s when you have a whole bunch of mirrors set
up to reflect sunlight to the top of a tower. If you get a few
hundred square meters of mirror focusing all that sunlight onto
a single point, you can heat up water, make it boil, and run a
turbine.”
I turned to Stratt. “But that’s not new. Heck, there’s a fully
functional solar thermal power plant in Spain right now. If you
want to know about it, talk to them.”
She silenced me with a hand motion. “And that’s what you
were making for New Zealand?”
“Well,” he said. “It was funded by New Zealand. But the idea
was to provide power for Africa.”
“Why would New Zealand pay a bunch of money to help
Africa?” I asked.
“Because we’re nice,” Redell said.
“Wow,” I said. “I know New Zealand is pretty cool but—”
“And it was going to be a New Zealand–owned company that
charged for the power,” Redell said.
“There it is.”
He leaned forward. “Africa needs infrastructure. To do that,
they need power. And they have nine million square kilometers
of useless land that gets some of the most intense continuous
sunlight on Earth. The Sahara Desert is just sitting there, waiting
to give them everything they need. All we needed to do was
build the damn power plants!”
He flopped back in his chair. “But every local government
wanted a piece of the pie. Graft, bribes, payoffs, you name it.
You think I embezzled a lot? Shit, that’s nothing compared to
what I had to pay in bribes just to build a solar plant in the
middle of fucking nowhere.”
“And then?” Stratt said.
He looked at his shoes. “We built a pilot plant—one square
kilometer of mirror area. All of it focused on a large metal
drum full of water on top of a tower. Boil the water, run a
turbine, you know the drill. I had a crew checking the drum for
leaks. When anyone’s in the tower, the mirrors are supposed to
be angled away. But someone in the control room fired up the
whole system when they thought they were starting a virtual
test.”
He sighed. “Seven people. All dead in an instant. At least they
didn’t suffer. Much. Someone had to pay. The victims were all
New Zealanders, and so am I. So the government came after
me. It was a farce of a trial.”
“And the embezzlement?” I said.
He nodded. “Yeah, that came up in the trial too. But I would
have gotten away with it if the project had been successful. I’m
not to blame here. I mean, yeah, stealing money, okay, I’m
guilty of that. But I didn’t kill those people. Not through
negligence or any other means.”
“Where were you when the accident happened?” Stratt said.
He paused.
“Where were you?” she repeated.
“I was in Monaco. On a vacation.”
“You’d been there for three months on that vacation.
Gambling away your embezzled money.”
“I…have a gambling problem,” he said. “I admit that. I mean,
it was gambling debt that made me embezzle in the first place.
It’s a sickness.”
“And what if you had been doing your job instead of going
on a bender for three months? What if you’d been there the day
the accident happened? Would the accident still have
happened?”
His expression was answer enough.
“Okay,” Stratt said. “Now we’re past the excuses and bullshit.
You’re not going to convince me you’re an innocent scapegoat.
And now you know that. So let’s move on: Tell me about
blackpanels.”
“Yeah, okay.” He composed himself. “I’ve spent my whole
life in the energy sector, so obviously Astrophage is really
interesting to me. A storage medium like that—man, if it
weren’t for what it’s doing to the sun, it would be the greatest
stroke of luck for humanity in history.”
He shifted in his seat. “Nuclear reactors, coal plants, solar
thermal plants…in the end they all do the same thing: Use heat
to boil water, use the steam to drive a turbine. But with
Astrophage, we don’t need any of that crap. It turns heat directly
into stored energy. And it doesn’t even need a big heat
differential. Just anything above 96.415 degrees.”
“We know that,” I said. “I’ve been using a nuclear reactor’s
heat to breed up Astrophage for the last several months.”
“What’d you get? Maybe a few grams? My idea can get you a
thousand kilograms per day. In a few years you’ll have enough
for the whole Hail Mary mission. It’ll take you longer than that
to build the ship anyway.”
“All right, you have my attention,” I said. Of course, Stratt
hadn’t told me anything about whatever “blackpanel” was.
“Get a square of metal foil. Pretty much any metal will do.
Anodize it until it’s black. Don’t paint it—anodize it. Put clear
glass over it and leave a one-centimeter gap between the glass
and the foil. Seal the edges with brick, foam, or some other
good insulator. Then set it out in the sun.”
“Okay, what good will that do?”
“The black foil will absorb sunlight and get hot. The glass will
insulate it from outside air—any heat loss has to pass through
the glass, and that’s slow. It’ll reach an equilibrium temperature
well over one hundred degrees Celsius.”
I nod. “And at that temperature you can enrich Astrophage.”
“Yes.”
“But it would be ridiculously slow,” I said. “If you had a onesquare-meter box and ideal weather conditions…say, one
thousand watts per square meter of solar energy…”
“It’s about half a microgram per day,” he said. “Give or take.”
“That’s a far cry from ‘a thousand kilograms’ per day.”
He smiled. “It’s just a matter of how many square meters you
make of it.”
“You’d need two trillion square meters to get a thousand
kilograms per day.”
“The Sahara Desert is nine trillion square meters.”
My jaw dropped open.
“That went by fast,” said Stratt. “Explain.”
“Well,” I said. “He wants to pave a chunk of the Sahara
Desert with blackpanels. Like…a quarter of the entire Sahara
Desert!”
“It’d be the biggest thing ever made by humanity,” he said.
“It’d be starkly visible from space.”
I glared at him. “And it would destroy the ecology of Africa
and probably Europe.”
“Not as much as the coming ice age will.”
Stratt held up her hand. “Dr. Grace. Would it work?”
I fidgeted. “Well, I mean…it’s a sound concept. But I don’t
know if it’s even possible to implement. This isn’t like making a
building or a road. We’re talking about literally trillions of these
things.”
Redell leaned in. “That’s why I designed the blackpanels to be
made entirely out of foil, glass, and ceramics. All materials we
have plenty of here on Earth.”
“Wait,” I said. “How do the Astrophage breed in this
scenario? Your blackpanels will enrich them, sure, and they’ll be
breed-ready. But there are a bunch of steps they need to go
through when they breed.”
“Oh, I know.” He smirked. “We’ll have a static magnet in
there to give them a magnetic field to follow—they need that to
kick off their migration response. Then we’ll have a small IR
filter on one part of the glass. It’ll only let the CO2
IR spectral
signature wavelengths through. The Astrophage will go there to
breed. Then, after dividing, they’ll head toward the glass
because that’s the direction of the sun. We’ll have a small
pinhole somewhere in the side of the panel for air exchange
with the outside. It’ll be slow enough that it doesn’t cool down
the panel, but fast enough to replenish the CO2 used by
Astrophage while breeding.”
I opened my mouth to protest, but I couldn’t find anything
wrong with it. He’d thought it all through.
“Well?” said Stratt.
“As a breeder system it’s horrible,” I said. “Way less efficient
and far lower yield than my system on the carrier’s reactor. But
he didn’t design it for efficiency. He designed it for scalability.”
“That’s right,” he said. He pointed to Stratt. “I hear you have
godlike authority over pretty much the whole world right now.”
“That’s an exaggeration,” she said.
“Not much of one, though,” I said.
Redell continued. “Can you get China to orient their
industrial base around making blackpanels? Not just them but
pretty much every industrial nation on Earth? That’s what it
would take.”
She pursed her lips. After a moment, she said, “Yes.”
“And can you tell the goddamned corrupt government
officials in North Africa to stay out of the way?”
“That part will be easy,” she said. “When this is all over,
those governments will keep the blackpanels. They’ll be the
industrial-energy powerhouse of the world.”
“See, there we go,” he said. “Save the world and permanently
lift Africa out of poverty while we’re at it. Of course, this is all
just a theory. I have to develop the blackpanel and make sure we
can mass-produce it. I’d need to be in a lab instead of prison.”
Stratt mulled it over. Then she stood.
“Okay. You’re with us.”
He pumped his fist.
—
I wake up in my bed, which is mounted to the tunnel wall. That
first night was a kludge with duct tape. Since then, I learned that
epoxy glue works well on xenonite, so I was able to attach a
couple of anchor points and mount the mattress properly.
I sleep in the tunnel every night now. Rocky insists. And,
once every eighty-six hours or so, Rocky sleeps in the tunnel
and wants me to watch. Well, he’s only slept three times so far,
so my data on his waking period is a bit sparse. But he’s been
kind of consistent on it.
I stretch out my arms and yawn.
“Good Morning,” Rocky says.
It’s pitch-dark. I turn on the lamp mounted next to the bed.
Rocky has an entire workshop set up on his side of the tunnel.
He’s always making modifications or repairs to something or
other. Seems like his ship is constantly in need of repair. Right
this moment he holds an oblong metal device with two of his
hands and uses another two to poke at the innards with needlelike tools. The remaining hand grasps a handle on the wall.
“Mornin’,” I say. “I’m going to eat. I’ll be back.”
Rocky waves absently. “Eat.”
I float down to the dormitory for my morning ritual. I eat a
prepackaged breakfast (scrambled eggs with pork sausage) and
a bag of hot coffee.
It’s been a few days since I last cleaned up, and I can smell
my own body odor. Not a good sign. So I sponge off at the
sponge-bath station and get a clean jumpsuit. All this
technology and I haven’t seen any means of cleaning clothing.
So I’ve taken to soaking it in water and putting it in the lab
freezer for a while. Kills off all the germs, and those are what
cause the smell. Fresh, not-clean clothes.
I pull the jumpsuit on. I’ve decided today is the day. After a
week of honing our language skills, Rocky and I are ready to
start having real conversations. I can even understand him
without having to look at the translation about a third of the
time now.
I float back to the tunnel, sipping the last of my coffee.
Okay. Finally I think we have the words needed for this
discussion. Here goes.
I clear my throat. “Rocky. I am here because Astrophage
makes Sol sick but doesn’t make Tau Ceti sick. Are you here for
the same reason?”
Rocky puts the device and his tools on his bandoleer and
climbs along the support rails to the divider. Good. He
understands this is a serious conversation.
“Yes. No understand why Tau not sick but Eridani is sick. If
Astrophage no leave Eridani, my people die.”
“Same!” I say. “Same same same! If Astrophage continues to
infect Sol, all the humans will die.”
“Good. Same. You and me will save Eridani and Sol.”
“Yes yes yes!”
“Why did other humans on you ship die, question?” Rocky
asks.
Oh. So we’re going to talk about that?
I rub the back of my head. “We, uh…we slept all the way
here. Not a normal sleep. A special sleep. A dangerous sleep,
but necessary. My crewmates died, but I didn’t. Random luck.”
“Bad,” he says.
“Bad. Why did the other Eridians die?”
“I not know. Everyone get sick. Then everyone die.” His voice
quavers. “I not sick. I not know why.”
“Bad,” I say with a sigh. “What kind of sick?”
He thinks for a moment. “I need word. Small life. Single thing.
Like Astrophage. Eridian body made of many many of these.”
“Cell,” I say. “My body is many many cells also.”
He says the Eridian word for “cell,” and I add the tones to my
ever-growing dictionary.
“Cell,” he says. “My crew have problem with cells. Many many
cells die. Not infection. Not injury. No reason. But not me. Never
me. Why, question? I not know.”
Each individual cell in the affected Eridians died? That
sounds horrible. It also sounds like radiation sickness. How am I
going to describe that? I shouldn’t have to. If they’re a
spacefaring people, they should already understand radiation.
We don’t have a word for it between us yet, though. Let’s work
on that.
“I need a word: fast-moving hydrogen atoms. Very very fast.”
“Hot gas.”
“No. Faster than that. Very very very fast.”
He wiggles his carapace. He’s confused.
I try another approach. “Space has very very very fast
hydrogen atoms. They move almost the speed of light. They
were created by stars long long long ago.”
“No. No mass in space. Space is empty.”
Oh boy. “No, that’s wrong. There are hydrogen atoms in
space. Very very fast hydrogen atoms.”
“Understand.”
“You didn’t know that?”
“No.”
I stare in shock.
How can a civilization develop space travel without ever
discovering radiation?
—
“Dr. Grace,” she said.
“Dr. Lokken,” I said.
We sat across from each other at a small steel table. It was a
tiny room, but spacious by aircraft-carrier standards. I didn’t
quite understand its original purpose and its name was written in
Chinese characters. But I think it was a place for the navigator
to look at charts…?
“Thank you for making time to see me,” she said.
“Not a problem.”
As a rule, we tried to avoid each other. Our relationship had
matured from “annoyed with each other” to “very annoyed with
each other.” I was as much a part of the problem as she was.
But we got off on the wrong foot all those months ago back in
Geneva and never really improved.
“Of course, I don’t think this is necessary.”
“Neither do I,” I said. “But Stratt insisted you run this stuff by
me. So here we are.”
“I have an idea. But I want your opinion.” She pulled out a
file and handed it to me. “CERN is going to release this paper
next week. This is a rough draft. But I know everyone there, so
they let me see an advance copy.”
I opened the folder. “Okay, what’s it about?”
“They figured out how Astrophage stores energy.”
“Really?!” I gasped. Then I cleared my throat. “Really?”
“Yes, and frankly it’s amazing.” She pointed to a graph on the
first page. “Long story short: It’s neutrinos.”
“Neutrinos?” I shook my head. “How the heck…”
“I know. It’s very counterintuitive. But there’s a large neutrino
burst every time they kill an Astrophage. They even took
samples to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and punctured
them in the main detector pool. They got a massive number of
hits. Astrophage can only contain neutrinos if it’s alive, and
there’s a lot of them in there.”
“How does it make neutrinos?”
She flipped a few pages in the paper and pointed to another
chart. “This is more your area than mine, but microbiologists
have confirmed Astrophage has a lot of free hydrogen ions—
raw protons with no electron—zipping around just inside the
cell membrane.”
“Yeah, I remember reading about that. It was a group in
Russia that found that out.”
She nodded. “CERN is pretty sure that, through a mechanism
we don’t understand, when those protons collide at a high
enough velocity, their kinetic energy is converted into two
neutrinos with opposite momentum vectors.”
I leaned back, confused. “That is really odd. Mass usually
doesn’t just ‘happen’ like that.”
She wiggled her hand. “Not quite true. Sometimes gamma
rays, when they pass close to an atomic nucleus, will
spontaneously become an electron and a positron. It’s called
‘pair production.’ So it’s not unheard-of. But we’ve never seen
neutrinos created that way.”
“That’s kind of neat. I never got too deep into atomic physics.
I’ve never heard of pair production before.”
“It’s a thing.”
“Okay.”
“Anyway,” she said, “there’s a lot of complicated stuff about
neutrinos I won’t get into—there are different kinds and they
can even change what kind they are. But the upshot is this:
They’re an extremely small particle. Their mass is something
like one twenty-billionth the mass of a proton.”
“Waaaaaait,” I said. “We know Astrophage is always 96.415
degrees Celsius. Temperature is just the velocity of particles
inside. So we should be able to calcu—”
“Calculate the velocity of the particles inside,” she said. “Yes.
We know the average velocity of the protons. And we know
their mass, which means we know their kinetic energy. I know
where you’re going with this and the answer is yes. It balances.”
“Wow!” I put my hand on my forehead. “That’s amazing!”
“Yes. It is.”
That was the answer to the long-asked question: Why is
Astrophage’s critical temperature what it is? Why not hotter?
Why not colder?
Astrophage makes neutrinos in pairs by slamming protons
together. For the reaction to work, the protons need to collide
with a higher kinetic energy than the mass energy of two
neutrinos. If you work backward from the mass of a neutrino,
you know the velocity those protons have to collide at. And
when you know the velocity of particles in an object, you know
its temperature. To have enough kinetic energy to make
neutrinos, the protons have to be 96.415 degrees Celsius.
“Oh man,” I said. “So any heat energy above the critical
temperature will just make the protons collide harder.”
“Yes. They’ll make neutrinos and have leftover energy. Then
they bump into other protons, et cetera. Any heat energy above
the critical temperature gets quickly converted into neutrinos.
But if it drops below critical temperature, the protons are going
too slow and neutrino production stops. End result: You can’t
get it hotter than 96.415 degrees. Not for long, anyway. And if
it gets too cold, the Astrophage uses stored energy to heat back
up to that temperature—just like any other warm-blooded lifeform.”
She gave me a moment to let that all sink in. CERN really
came through. But a couple of things still bothered me.
“Okay, so it makes neutrinos,” I said. “How does it turn them
back into energy?”
“That’s the easy part,” she said. “Neutrinos are what’s called
Majorana particles. It means the neutrino is its own antiparticle.
Basically, every time two neutrinos collide, it’s a matterantimatter interaction. They annihilate and become photons.
Two photons, actually, with the same wavelength and going
opposite directions. And since the wavelength of a photon is
based on the energy in the photon…”
“The Petrova wavelength!” I yelped.
She nodded. “Yes. The mass energy of a neutrino is exactly
the same as the energy found in one photon of Petrovawavelength light. This paper is truly groundbreaking.”
I rested my chin on my hands. “Wow…just wow. I guess the
only remaining question is how does an Astrophage keep
neutrinos inside?”
“We don’t know. Neutrinos routinely pass through the entire
planet Earth without hitting a single atom—they’re just that
small. Well, it’s more about quantum wavelengths and
probabilities of collision. But suffice it to say, neutrinos are
famously hard to interact with. But for some reason, Astrophage
has what we call ‘super cross-sectionality.’ That’s just a fancy
term meaning nothing can quantum-tunnel through it. It goes
against every law of particle physics we thought we knew, but
it’s been proven over and over.”
“Yeah.” I tapped my finger on the table. “It absorbs all
wavelengths of light—even wavelengths that should be too large
to interact with it.”
“Yes,” she said. “Turns out it also collides with all matter that
tries to get by, no matter how unlikely that collision should be.
Anyway, as long as an Astrophage is alive, it exhibits this super
cross-sectionality. And that brings us nicely to what I wanted to
talk to you about.”
“Oh?” I said. “There’s more?”
“Yes.” She pulled a diagram of the Hail Mary hull out of her
bag. “This is what I need you for: I’m working on radiation
protection for the Hail Mary.”
I perked up. “Of course! Astrophage will block it all!”
“Maybe,” she said. “But I need to know how space radiation
works to be sure. I know the broad strokes, but not the details.
Please enlighten me.”
I folded my arms. “Well, there’s two kinds, really. Highenergy particles emitted by the sun, and GCRs that are just kind
of everywhere.”
“Start with the solar particles,” she said.
“Sure. Solar particles are just hydrogen atoms emitted by the
sun. Sometimes a magnetic storm on the sun can cause it to spit
out a whole bunch of them. Other times it’s relatively quiet. And
lately, the Astrophage infection has been robbing so much
energy from the sun that magnetic storms are less common.”
“Horrifying,” she said.
“I know. Did you hear that global warming has been almost
undone?”
She nodded. “Humanity’s recklessness with our environment
accidentally bought us an extra month of time by pre-heating
the planet.”
“We fell in poop and came out smelling like roses,” I said.
She laughed. “I have not heard that one. We don’t have that
expression in Norwegian.”
“You do now.” I smiled.
She looked down at the hull plan—a little faster than I think
was necessary, but whatever.
“How fast do these solar particles travel?” she asked.
“About four hundred kilometers per second.”
“Good. We can ignore them.” She scribbled a note to herself
on the paper. “The Hail Mary will be going away faster than that
within eight hours. They won’t be able to catch up, let alone do
any damage.”
I whistled. “It’s really amazing what we’re doing. I mean…
jeez. Astrophage would be the best thing ever if it weren’t, you
know, destroying the sun.”
“I know,” she said. “Now, tell me about GCRs.”
“Those are trickier,” I said. “It stands for—”
“Galactic cosmic rays,” she said. “And they’re not cosmic
rays, right?”
“Right. They’re just hydrogen ions—protons. But they’re
going a lot faster. They’re going near the speed of light.”
“Why are they called cosmic rays if they’re not even
electromagnetic emissions?”
“People used to think they were. The name stuck.”
“Do they come from some common source?”
“No, they’re omnidirectional. They’re made by supernovas,
which have happened all over the place. We’re just kind of
constantly awash with GCRs in all directions. And they’re a
huge problem for space travel. But not anymore!”
I leaned forward to look at her schematic again. It was a
cross-section of a hull. There was a 1-millimeter void between
two walls. “Are you going to fill that area with Astrophage?”
“That’s the plan.”
I pondered the schematic. “You want to fill the hull with fuel?
Isn’t that dangerous?”
“Only if we let it see CO2
-band light. If it doesn’t see CO2
, it
won’t do anything. And it’ll be in the dark between the hulls.
Dimitri plans to make a fuel slurry out of Astrophage and lowviscosity oil to make it easier to transport to the engines. I want
to line the hull with that stuff.”
I pinched my chin. “It could work. But Astrophage can die
from physical trauma. You can kill one by poking it with a sharp
nanostick.”
“Yes, that’s why I asked CERN to do some off-the-books
experiments for me as a favor.”
“Wow. CERN will just do whatever you want? Are you, like,
mini-Stratt or something?”
She chuckled. “Old friends and contacts. Anyway, they found
that even particles moving near light speed can’t get past
Astrophage. And none of them seem to kill it either.”
“That actually makes a lot of sense,” I said. “It evolved to live
on the surface of stars. They must get bombarded by energy and
very fast-moving particles all the time.”
She pointed to a zoomed-in schematic of Astrophage canals.
“The entire radiation load will be halted. All we need is a layer
of Astrophage slurry thick enough to guarantee there’s always
an Astrophage cell in the way of any incoming particles. One
millimeter should be more than enough. Plus, we don’t waste
any mass. We’ll be using the fuel itself as insulation. And if the
crew need that last little bit of Astrophage, well, consider it a
reserve.”
“Hmm…a ‘reserve’ that could power New York City for
twenty thousand years.”
She looked at the diagram, then back to me. “You did all that
math in your head?”
“Eh, I had some shortcuts. We’re dealing with such absurd
scales of energy here, I tend to think in ‘New York City years’
of energy, which is about one-half of one gram of Astrophage.”
She rubbed her temples. “And we need to make two million
kilograms of it. If we make a mistake along the way…”
“We’ll save Astrophage the trouble of destroying humanity by
doing it ourselves,” I say. “Yeah. I think about that a lot.”
“So, what do you think?” she said. “Is this a terrible idea, or
could it work?”
“I think it’s genius.”
She smiled and looked away.</p>
