  <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
  <p>Oh.
Okay.
I see how it is.
I’m not some intrepid explorer who nobly sacrificed his life to
save Earth. I’m a terrified man who had to be literally dragged
kicking and screaming onto the mission.
I’m a coward.
All that came to me in a flash. I sit on the stool and stare at
the lab table. I went from nearly hysterical to…this. This is
worse. I’m numb.
I’m a coward.
I’ve known for a while that I’m not the best hope for saving
mankind. I’m just a guy with the genes to survive a coma. I
made my peace with that a while ago.
But I didn’t know I was a coward.
I remember the emotions. I remember that feeling of panic. I
remember it all now. Sheer, unadulterated terror. Not for Earth
or humanity or the children. For myself. Utter panic.
“God damn you, Stratt,” I mumble.
What ticks me off the most is that she was right. Her plan
worked perfectly. I got my memory back, and now I’m so
committed to the mission I’m still going to give it my all. Plus,
come on, of course I was going to give it my all. What else
would I do? Let 7 billion people die to spite Stratt?
At some point, Rocky came through his tunnel to the lab. I
don’t know how long he’s been there. He didn’t have to come—
he could “see” everything going on from the control room with
his sonar sense. Still, there he is.
“You are very sad,” he says.
“Yeah.”
“I am sad also. But we not be sad for long. You are scientist. I
am engineer. Together we solve.”
I throw up my arms in frustration. “How?!”
He clicked along the tunnel to the closest point above me.
“Taumoeba eat all your fuel. Therefore Taumoeba survive and
breed in fuel-tank environment.”
“So?”
“Most life no can live outside its air. I die if not in Erid air. You
die if not in Earth air. But Taumoeba survive when not in Adrian
air. Taumoeba stronger than Erid life—stronger than Earth life.”
I crane my neck to look up at him. “True. And Astrophage
are also pretty tough. They can live in vacuum and on the
surface of stars.”
He tapped two claws together. “Yes yes. Astrophage and
Taumoeba from same biosphere. Probably evolve from common
ancestor. Adrian life is very strong.”
I sit up. “Yeah. Okay.”
“You have idea already. Not question. I know you. You have
idea already. Tell idea.”
I sigh. “Well…Venus, Threeworld, and Adrian all have a
bunch of carbon dioxide. The Astrophage breeding zone in all
three is where pressure is 0.02 atmospheres. So maybe I’ll start
with a chamber full of pure carbon dioxide at 0.02 atmospheres
and see if Taumoeba survives that. Then add in more gases one
at a time to see what the problem is.”
“Understand,” says Rocky.
I get to my feet and dust off my jumpsuit. “I need you to
make me a test chamber. Clear xenonite with valves so I can let
air in and out. Also, I need to be able to set temperature to
minus 100 degrees Celsius, minus 50 degrees Celsius, or minus
82 degrees Celsius.”
I could use my own equipment, but why not take advantage of
superior material and craftsmanship?
“Yes yes. I make now. We are team. We fix this. No be sad.”
He skitters down the tunnel toward the dormitory.
I check my watch. “The main thrust ends in thirty-four
minutes. After that’s done, let’s use the beetles to put ourselves
in centrifuge mode.”
Rocky pauses. “Dangerous.”
“Yeah, I know. But we need gravity for the lab and I don’t
want to wait eleven days. I want to make good use of time.”
“Beetles arranged for thrust, not rotation.”
It’s true. Our propulsion right now is, to say the least,
rudimentary. We don’t have servos or gimbals to vector our
thrust. We’re like a sixteenth-century nautical ship, but we’re
using beetles for sails. Actually, scratch that. The nautical ship
could at least control the angle of their sails. We’re more like a
paddlewheel boat with a broken rudder.
It’s not all bad, though. We have some slight attitude control
by deciding how much each engine thrusts. It’s how Rocky
zeroed out our rotation before. “It’s worth the risk.”
He skitters back up the tunnel to face me. “Ship will rotate
off-axis. No can unspool centrifuge cables. Would tangle.”
“We’ll create the needed rotation first, then shut off beetles,
then unspool cables.”
He draws back. “If ship not unspooled, force is too much for
human.”
That does present a problem. I want 1 g of gravity for the lab
when the ship is fully unspooled in two halves. To get that much
rotational inertia with the ship in one piece means spinning it
very fast. Last time we did that, I passed out in the control room
and Rocky almost died saving me.
“Okay…” I say. “How about this: I’ll lay down in the storage
room under the dormitory. That’s the closest to the center of
ship I can get. The force will be smallest there. I’ll be okay.”
“How you operate centrifuge controls from storage room,
question?”
“I’ll…umm…I’ll bring the lab’s control screen down there
with me. I’ll run data and power extension cables from the lab to
the storage room. Yeah. That should work.”
“What if you unconscious and no can operate controls,
question?”
“Then you cancel the rotation and I’ll wake up.”
He shimmies back and forth. “No like. Alternate plan: Wait
eleven days. Get to my ship. Clean out you ship fuel tanks.
Sterilize—make sure no Taumoeba. Refill with fuel from my
ship. Then can use all functions of you ship again.”
I shake my head. “I don’t want to wait eleven days. I want to
work now.”
“Why, question? Why no wait, question?”
He’s completely right, of course. I’m risking my life and
maybe the structural integrity of the Hail Mary. But I can’t just
sit around for eleven days when there’s so much work to do.
How do I explain “impatience” to someone who lives seven
hundred years?
“Human thing,” I say.
“Understand. Not actually understand, but…understand.”
—
The spin-up went as planned. Rocky selected Ringo to do the
spinning work, leaving John and Paul offline. George is still
safely aboard the ship in case I need him.
The g-forces during the spin-up were rough—I won’t lie. But
I stayed awake long enough to manually deal with the centrifuge
steps. I’m getting pretty good at it now. Since then, it’s been a
nice, level 1 g.
Yeah, it was impatient and a little risky, but thanks to that,
I’ve had seven days of hardcore science since then.
Rocky delivered on the testing apparatus as promised. As
always, everything worked flawlessly. Instead of a small,
annoying glass vacuum chamber, I had something resembling a
large fish tank. Xenonite doesn’t care if there’s a bunch of air
pressure on a large, flat panel. “Bring it on,” says xenonite.
I have, shall we say, an inexhaustible supply of Taumoeba.
The Hail Mary is currently the Taumoeba party bus. All I have
to do is open the fuel line that used to lead to the generator
when I want more.
—
“Hey, Rocky!” I call out from the lab. “Watch me pull a
Taumoeba out of a hat!”
Rocky climbs up his tunnel from the control room. “I assume
that is Earth idiom.”
“Yeah. Earth has entertainment called ‘television’ and—”
“Do not explain, please. You have findings, question?”
Just as well. It would take a long time to explain cartoons to
an alien. “I have some results.”
“Good good.” He hunkers down into a comfortable sitting
position. “Tell findings!” He tries to hide it, but his voice is just a
touch higher in pitch than normal.
I gesture to the lab apparatus. “This functions perfectly, by
the way.”
“Thank. Tell about findings.”
“My first experiment was Adrian’s environment. I added
Taumoeba and a slide covered in Astrophage. The Taumoeba
survived and ate it all. No surprise there.”
“No surprise. Is their native environment. But proves equipment
works.”
“Exactly. I did more tests to learn Taumoeba’s limits. In
Adrian air, they can live from minus 180 degrees Celsius to 107
degrees Celsius. Outside that range they die.”
“Impressive range.”
“Yes. Also, they can survive in a near vacuum.”
“Like your fuel tanks.”
“Yeah, but not a total vacuum.” I frown. “They need carbon
dioxide. At least a little bit of it. I made an Adrian environment
but put argon in instead of carbon dioxide. The Taumoeba
didn’t eat anything. They stayed dormant. Eventually they
starved to death.”
“Expected,” he says. “Astrophage need carbon dioxide.
Taumoeba from same ecology. Taumoeba also need carbon
dioxide. How they get carbon dioxide in fuel tanks, question?”
“I had the same question!” I say. “So I did a spectrograph of
my fuel-bay sludge. There’s a bunch of CO2 gas dissolved into
the liquid.”
“Astrophage probably have carbon dioxide inside. Or
decomposition creates carbon dioxide. Some percentage died in
fuel tanks over time. Not all cells are perfect. Defects. Mutations.
Some die. Those dead Astrophage put carbon dioxide in tanks.”
“Agreed.”
“Good findings,” he says. He starts climbing back down.
“Wait. I have more. Much more.”
He stops. “More, question? Good.”
I lean against my lab table and pat the tank. “I made Venus in
the tank. But not quite Venus. Venus’s air is 96.5 percent carbon
dioxide and 3.5 percent nitrogen. I started with just the carbon
dioxide. The Taumoeba were fine. Then I added the nitrogen.
And the Taumoeba all died.”
He raises his carapace. “All die, question? Sudden, question?”
“Yes,” I say. “In seconds. All dead.”
“Nitrogen…unexpected.”
“Yeah, very unexpected!” I say. “I repeated experiment with
Threeworld’s air. Carbon dioxide only: The Taumoeba were
fine. I added in the sulfur dioxide: The Taumoeba were fine. I
added the nitrogen: Boom! All the Taumoeba died.”
He taps a claw absently on the tunnel wall. “Very very
unexpected. Nitrogen harmless to Erid life. Nitrogen required by
many Erid life.”
“Same with Earth,” I say. “Earth’s air is seventy-eight percent
nitrogen.”
“Confusing,” he says.
He’s not alone. I’m just as baffled as he is. We’re both
thinking the same thing: If all life evolved from a single source,
how can nitrogen be critical to two biospheres and toxic to a
third?
Nitrogen is utterly harmless and nearly inert in its gaseous
state. It’s usually content to be N2
, which barely wants to react
with anything. Human bodies ignore the stuff despite every
breath being 78 percent nitrogen. As for Erid, their atmosphere
is mostly ammonia—a nitrogen compound. How could a
panspermia event ever seed Earth and Erid—two nitrogenriddled planets—if a tiny amount of nitrogen kills that life?
Well, the answer to that is easy: Whatever the life-form was
that caused the panspermia, it didn’t have a problem with
nitrogen. Taumoeba, which evolved later, does.
Rocky’s carapace sinks. “Situation bad. Threeworld air is eight
percent nitrogen.”
I sit on the lab stool and cross my arms. “Venus’s air is 3.5
percent nitrogen. Same problem.”
He sinks farther and his voice drops an octave. “Hopeless.
Cannot change Threeworld air. Cannot change Venus air.
Cannot change Taumoeba. Hopeless.”
“Well,” I say. “We can’t change Threeworld or Venus’s air.
But maybe we can change Taumoeba.”
“How, question?”
I grab my tablet from the workbench and scroll through my
notes about Eridian physiology. “Do Eridians have diseases?
Sicknesses inside your bodies?”
“Some. Very, very bad.”
“How does your body kill diseases?”
“Eridian body is closed,” he explains. “Only opening happen
when eat or lay egg. After opening seals, area inside made very
hot inside with hot blood for long time. Kill any disease. Disease
can only get into body through wound. Then is very bad. Body
shut down infected area. Heat with hot blood to kill disease. If
disease fast, Eridian die.”
No immune system at all. Just heat. Well, why not? The hot
circulatory system of an Eridian boils water to make the
muscles move. Why not use it to cook and sterilize incoming
food too? And with heavy oxides—basically rocks—as skin,
they don’t get many cuts or abrasions. Even their lungs don’t
exchange material with the outside. If any pathogens do get in,
the body seals the area off and boils it. An Eridian body is a
nearly impenetrable fortress.
But a human body is more like a borderless police state.
“Humans are very different,” I say. “We get diseases all the
time. We have very powerful immune systems. Also, we find
cures for diseases in nature. The word is ‘antibiotics.’ ”
“No understand,” he says. “Cures for diseases in nature,
question? How, question?”
“Other life on Earth evolved defenses against the same
diseases. They emit chemicals that kill the disease without
harming other cells. Humans eat those chemicals and they kill
disease but not our human cells.”
“Amaze. Erid no have this.”
“It’s not a perfect system, though,” I say. “Antibiotics work
very well at first, but then over the years, they become less and
less effective. Eventually they barely work at all.”
“Why, question?”
“Diseases change. Antibiotics kill almost all the disease in the
body, but some survive. By using antibiotics, humans are
accidentally teaching diseases how to survive those antibiotics.”
“Ah!” Rocky says. He raises his carapace a tad. “Disease
evolves defense against chemical that kills it.”
“Yes,” I say. I point at the tank. “Now think of Taumoeba as
disease. Think of nitrogen as antibiotic.”
He pauses, then raises his carapace back to its proper
location. “Understand! Make environment barely deadly. Breed
Taumoeba that survive. Make more deadly. Breed survivors.
Repeat, repeat, repeat!”
“Yes,” I say. “We don’t need to understand why or how
nitrogen kills Taumoeba. We just need to breed nitrogenresistant Taumoeba.”
“Yes!” he says.
“Good!” I slap the top of the tank. “Make me ten of these,
but smaller. Also provide a way for me to get Taumoeba
samples without interrupting the experiment. Make a very
accurate gas injection system—I need exact control over the
nitrogen quantity in the tank.”
“Yes! I make! I make now!”
He skitters down to the dormitory.
—
I check the results of the spectrograph and shake my head. “No
good. Complete failure.”
“Sad,” Rocky says.
I put my chin in my hands. “Maybe I can filter out the
toxins.”
“Maybe you can concentrate on Taumoeba.” There’s a special
warble that Rocky does when he’s being snarky. That warble is
especially present right now.
“They’re coming along fine.” I glance over to the Taumoeba
processing tanks arrayed along one side of the lab. “Nothing to
do but wait. We’ve had good results. They’re already up to 0.01
percent nitrogen and surviving. The next generation might be
able to go as high as 0.015.”
“This is waste of time. Also waste of my food.”
“I need to know if I can eat your food.”
“Eat your own food.”
“I’ve only got a few months of real food left. You have
enough aboard your ship to feed a crew of twenty-three Eridians
for years. Erid life and Earth life use the same proteins. Maybe I
can eat your food.”
“Why you say ‘real food,’ question? What is non-real food,
question?”
I checked the readout again. Why does Eridian food have so
many heavy metals in it? “Real food is food that tastes good.
Food that’s fun to eat.”
“You have not-fun food, question?”
“Yeah. Coma slurry. The ship fed it to me during the trip
here. I have enough to last me almost four years.”
“Eat that.”
“It tastes bad.”
“Food experience not that important.”
“Hey.” I point at him. “To humans, food experience is very
important.”
“Humans strange.”
I point at the spectrometer readout screen. “Why does Eridian
food have thallium in it?”
“Healthy.”
“Thallium kills humans!”
“Then eat human food.”
“Ugh.” I walk over to the Taumoeba tanks. Rocky had
outdone himself. I can control the nitrogen content to within
one part per million. And so far, things are looking good. Sure,
this generation can only handle a smidgen of nitrogen, but it’s a
smidgen more than the previous generation could do.
The plan is working. Our Taumoeba are developing nitrogen
resistance.
Will they ever be able to handle the 3.5 percent needed for
Venus? Or the 8 percent for Threeworld? Who knows? We’ll
just have to wait and see.
I’m using percentages here to track the nitrogen. I can only
get away with that because in all cases, Astrophage breed where
the air is 0.02 atmospheres of pressure. So, since the pressure is
always the same across all experiments, I can just track the
percent of nitrogen.
The proper way to do it would be to track “partial pressure.”
But that’s annoying. I’d just end up dividing by 0.02
atmospheres and multiplying by it again later when dealing with
data.
I pat the top of Tank Three. It’s been my lucky tank. Out of
twenty-three generations of Taumoeba, Tank Three made the
strongest strain nine times. Pretty good, considering she’s got
nine other tanks to compete with.
Yes, Tank Three is a “she.” Don’t judge me.
“How long until we reach the Blip-A?”
“Seventeen hours until reverse-thrust maneuver.”
“Okay, let’s spin down the centrifuge now. Just in case we run
into trouble and need extra time to fix something.”
“Agree. I go to control room now. You go to storage locker and
lie flat. Do not forget control panel with long extension cords.”
I glance around the lab. Everything is firmly secured. “Yeah,
okay. Let’s do it.”
—
“John, Ringo, Paul off,” says Rocky. “Velocity is orbital.”
There is no “stationary” in a solar system. You’re always
moving around something. In this case, Rocky reduced our
cruise velocity to put us in a stable orbit about 1 AU from Tau
Ceti. That’s where he left the Blip-A.
Rocky relaxes in his control-room bulb. He clamps the boxes
to their wall mounts. Now that the engines are off we’re back to
zero g, and the last thing we want is for the “make ship thrust”
button to be floating around unattended.
He grabs a couple of handholds and centers his carapace over
the texture monitor. As always, it shows him my center monitor
feed with colors represented as textures.
“You in control now.” He’s done his job. Now it’s my turn.
“How long until the flash?” I ask
Rocky pulls an Eridian clock off the wall. “Next flash is three
minutes, seven seconds.”
“Okay.”
Rocky’s no dope. He left his ship set up to turn on its engines
for a fraction of a second every twenty minutes or so, giving us
a much-needed beacon. It’s easy enough to math out where the
ship should be. But gravity from other planets, inaccurate
measurement of last known velocities, inaccuracies in our
estimate of Tau Ceti’s gravity…they all add up to make slight
errors. And a slight error on the location of something orbiting a
star is a pretty big distance.
So rather than hoping we can see Taulight reflect off the ship
when we get to where it should be, he just set it up to flash the
engines now and then. All I have to do is watch with the
Petrovascope. It’ll be an extremely bright flash.
“What is current nitrogen tolerance, question?”
“Tank Three had some survivors at 0.6 percent nitrogen
today. I’m breeding them up now.”
“What spacing, question?”
It’s a conversation we’ve had dozens of times. But it’s fair for
him to be curious. His species depends on it.
The “spacing,” as we’ve come to call it, is the difference in
how much nitrogen each of the ten tanks receives. I don’t just
do the same thing in every tank. With each new generation, I try
ten new percentages of nitrogen.
“I’m being aggressive—0.05 percent increments.”
“Good good,” he says.
All ten tanks are breeding Taumoeba-06 (named for the
nitrogen percent it can withstand). Tank One is the control, as
always. It has 0.6 percent nitrogen in the air. Taumoeba-06
should have no problem in there. If it does, it means there was a
mistake in the previous batch and I have to go back to an earlier
strain.
Tank Two has 0.65 percent nitrogen. Tank Three has 0.7.
And so on all the way up to Tank Ten with 1.05 percent. The
heartiest survivors will be the champions, and will move on to
the next round. I wait a few hours just to make sure they can
breed for at least two generations. Taumoeba has a ridiculously
fast doubling time. Fast enough to eat all my fuel in a matter of
days, as it happens.
If we get to Venus or Threeworld nitrogen percentages, I’ll do
much more thorough testing.
“Flash is soon,” Rocky says.
“Copy.”
I bring up the Petrovascope on the center monitor. Normally,
I’d have it off to the side, but the center is the only one Rocky
can “see.” As expected, there’s just background light in the
Petrova frequency courtesy of Tau Ceti. I pan and tilt the
camera. We deliberately positioned ourselves closer to Tau Ceti
than the Blip-A should be. So I’m looking more or less directly
away from the star. That should minimize the background IR
and give me a good view of the flash.
“Okay. I think I have it pointed roughly toward your ship.”
Rocky concentrates on his texture monitor. “Understand.
Thirty-seven seconds until flash.”
“Hey. What’s is your ship’s name, anyway?”
“Blip-A.”
“No, I mean, what do you call it?”
“Ship.”
“Your ship has no name?”
“Why would ship have name, question?”
I shrugged. “Ships have names.”
He points to my pilot’s seat. “What is name of you chair,
question?”
“It doesn’t have a name.”
“Why does ship have name but chair no have name, question?”
“Never mind. Your ship is the Blip-A.”
“That is what I said. Flash in ten seconds.”
“Copy.”
Rocky and I each fall silent and stare at our respective
screens. It took me a long time to notice the subtleties, but I can
now tell when Rocky is paying attention to something specific.
He tends to angle his carapace toward it and pivot ever so
slightly back and forth. If I follow the line he’s pivoting on,
that’s usually what he’s examining.
“Three…two…one…now!”
Right on cue, a few pixels on-screen blink white.
“Got it,” I say.
“I not notice.”
“It was dim. We must be far away. Hang on…” I switch to the
Telescope screen and pan to where the flash came from. I sweep
back and forth with small movements until I catch a slight
discoloration in the blackness. Taulight reflecting off the Blip-A.
“Yeah, we’re pretty far away.”
“Beetles have much fuel remaining. Is okay. Tell me angle
change.”
I check the readouts at the bottom of the screen. All we have
to do is align the Hail Mary with the current telescope angle.
“Rotate yaw plus 13.72 degrees. Rotate pitch minus 9.14
degrees.”
“Yaw plus one three mark seven two. Pitch minus nine mark
one four.” He grabs the beetle controls from their holders and
gets to work. By flicking on and off the beetles in sequence, he
angles the ship toward the Blip-A.
I zero the telescope and zoom in to confirm. The difference
between background space and the ship is so small as to be
barely perceivable. But it’s there. “Angle correct.”
He focuses hard on his texture screen. “I no detect anything
on-screen.”
“Light difference is very very small. Need human eyes to
detect. Angle is good.”
“Understand. What is range, question?”
I switch to the Radar screen. Nothing. “Too far for my radar
to see. At least ten thousand kilometers.”
“Accelerate to what velocity, question?”
“How about…three kilometers per second? Will get to the
Blip-A in an hour or so.”
“Three thousand meters per second. Standard acceleration rate
is acceptable, question?”
“Yes. Fifteen meters per second per second.”
“Two hundred second thrust. Begin now.”
I brace for gravity.</p>
