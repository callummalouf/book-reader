  <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
  <p>I glared at the Astrophage. “Why the heck do you go to
Venus?”
The microscope view was displayed on the big wall-mounted
monitor. Each of the three little cells were a foot across at this
magnification. I watched for any clues to their motivations, but
Larry, Curly, and Moe offered no answer.
I’d named them, of course. It’s a teacher thing.
“What’s so special about Venus? And how do you even find
it?” I crossed my arms. If Astrophage understood body
language, they’d know I wasn’t messing around. “It takes a room
full of really smart people at NASA to work out how to get to
Venus. And you do it as a single-celled organism with no brain.”
It had been two days since Stratt left me alone with the lab.
The army guys were still at the doors. One was named Steve.
Friendly guy. The other never spoke to me.
I ran my hands through my greasy hair (I’d neglected to
shower that morning). At least I didn’t have to wear the hazmat
suit anymore. Scientists in Nairobi had taken a chance with one
of their Astrophage and exposed it to Earth atmosphere to see
what happened. It was unaffected. So, thanks to them, labs all
over the world could breathe a sigh of relief and stop working in
argon-filled rooms.
I glanced at the pile of papers on a desk. The scientific
community had moved into overdrive in a very unscientific way.
Gone were the days of careful peer review and published
articles. Astrophage research was a free-for-all where
researchers posted their findings immediately and without
proof. It led to misunderstandings and mistakes, but we just
didn’t have time to do things the right way.
Stratt kept me in the loop on most stuff. Not everything, I was
sure. Who knows what other weird things she was up to. She
seemed to have authority everywhere.
A Belgian research team was able to prove that Astrophage
reacts to magnetic fields, but only sometimes. Other times, it
seems to ignore magnetic fields entirely, no matter how
powerful. Still, the Belgians were able to (very inconsistently)
steer Astrophage around by putting it in a magnetic field and
changing the field’s orientation. Was that useful? No idea. At
this point the world was just collecting data.
A researcher in Paraguay showed that ants will get
disoriented when they’re within a few centimeters of
Astrophage. Was that useful? Okay, that one probably wasn’t
useful. But it was interesting.
Most notably, a group in Perth sacrificed one of their
Astrophage and did a detailed analysis on all the organelles
inside. They found DNA and mitochondria. In any other
situation, this would have been the most important discovery of
the century. Alien life—indisputably alien—had DNA and
mitochondria!
And…grumble…a bunch of water…
Point is: The inside of an Astrophage wasn’t much different
from the inside of any single-celled organism you’d find on
Earth. It used ATP, RNA transcription, and a whole host of
other extremely familiar things. Some researchers speculated
that it originated on Earth. Others postulated this specific set of
molecules was the only way for life to occur and Astrophage
evolved it independently. And a smaller, vocal faction suggested
life might not have evolved on Earth at all, and that Astrophage
and terrestrial life have a common ancestor.
“You know,” I told the Astrophage, “if you boys weren’t
threatening all life on my planet, you’d be pretty awesome. You
have mysteries within mysteries.”
I leaned against a table. “You have mitochondria. Okay, so
that means you use ATP as your energy storage, just like we do.
But the light you use to move around requires waaaay more
energy than your ATP can hold. So you have another energystorage pathway. One we don’t understand.”
One of the Astrophage on-screen darted slightly to the left. It
was pretty common. Once in a while, for no real reason, they’d
just wiggle.
“What makes you move? Why move? And how does this
random jerky motion get you from the sun to Venus? And why
do you go to Venus at all?!”
Lots of people were working on the internals of Astrophage.
Trying to figure out what made it tick. Analyzing its DNA.
Good for them. I wanted to know the basic life-cycle. That was
my goal.
Single-celled organisms don’t just store buttloads of energy
and fly through space for no reason. There had to be something
Astrophage needed from Venus or it would just stay on the sun.
And it needed something from the sun, too, or it would stay on
Venus.
The sun part was pretty easy: It was there for the energy.
Same reason plants grew leaves. Got to get that sweet, sweet
energy if you’re going to be a life-form. Makes perfect sense. So
what about Venus?
I picked up a pen and fidgeted with it as I thought.
“According to the Indian Space Research Organization, you
guys get going up to 0.92 times the speed of light.” I pointed at
them. “Didn’t know we could do that, did ya? Figure out your
velocity? They used Doppler-shift analysis of the light you emit
to work it out. And because of that, they also know you’re going
both directions: to and from Venus.”
I frowned. “But if you hit an atmosphere at that speed you
should die. So why don’t you?”
I rapped my forehead with a knuckle. “Because you can
handle any amount of heat. Right. So you blast into the
atmosphere, but you don’t get any hotter. Okay, but you’d have
to at least slow down. So you’d just be in the upper atmosphere
of Venus. Then you…what? Turn around and go back to the
sun? Why?”
I stared at the screen for a solid ten minutes, lost in thought.
“All right, enough of this. I want to know how you find
Venus.”
I went to the local hardware store and bought a bunch of twoby-fours, three-quarter-inch plywood, power tools, and other
stuff I’d need. Steve the army guy helped me carry a lot of it in.
Jerk army guy did nothing.
Over the next six hours, I built a lightproof closet with a shelf
in it. It was just big enough for me to get in and out. I set the
microscope on the shelf. The “door” was a plywood panel that I
could remove with screws.
I ran power and video lines into the closet through a little hole
that I plugged up with putty to make sure no light could get in
through there either. I set my IR camera up on the microscope
and sealed up the closet.
Out in the lab, the monitor showed the infrared light the
camera saw. It was basically a frequency shift. Very low bands
of IR would show up as red. Higher-energy bands would be
orange, yellow, and so on up the rainbow. I could see the
Astrophage cells as little red blobs, which was expected. At their
constant temperature of 96.415 degrees Celsius they would
naturally emit an IR wavelength of 7.8 microns or so—the low
end of what I’d set the camera to look for. It was good
confirmation that the setup was working.
But I didn’t care about that dark-red color. I wanted to see a
bright-yellow flash. That would be the Petrova frequency that
Astrophage spit out to move around. If any of my Astrophages
moved even the tiniest amount, I’d see a very obvious yellow
flash.
But it never came. Nothing happened. Nothing at all. Usually,
I’d see a jerky motion from at least one of them every few
seconds. But now there was nothing.
“So,” I said. “You little brats have settled down, eh?”
Light. Whatever their navigation system was, it was based on
light. I suspected that would be the case. What else could you
use in space? There’s no sound. No smell. It would have to be
light, gravity, or electromagnetism. And light’s the easiest of
those three to detect. At least, as far as evolution is concerned.
For my next experiment, I taped a little white LED and a
watch battery together. Of course, I wired it backward at first
and the LED didn’t light up. That’s pretty much a rule in
electronics: You never get diodes right on the first try. Anyway,
I rewired it correctly and the LED lit up. I taped the whole
contraption to the inside wall of the closet. I made sure to
position it so the Astrophage on the sample slide would have a
direct line of sight on it. Then I sealed everything up again.
Now, from the Astrophage’s point of view, there was a lot of
black nothingness and one shining spot of white. That’s kind of
what Venus might look like if you were out in space and looking
directly away from the sun.
They didn’t budge. No hint of motion at all.
“Hmph,” I said.
To be fair, it wasn’t likely to work. If you were at the sun,
looking away from it for the brightest splotch of light you could
see, you’d probably zero in on Mercury, not Venus. Mercury is
smaller than Venus, but it’s a lot closer so you’d see more light.
“Why Venus?” I mused. But then I thought of a better
question. “How do you guys identify Venus?”
Why did they move randomly? My theory: By pure chance,
every few seconds or so, an Astrophage thought it had spotted
Venus. So it thrusted in that direction. But then the moment
passed, so it stopped thrusting.
The key had to be frequencies of light. My boys didn’t wiggle
at all in darkness. But it wasn’t just about the sheer volume of
light, or they would have gone for the LED. It had to be
something about the frequency of the light.
Planets don’t just reflect light. They also emit it. Everything
emits light. The temperature of the object defines the
wavelength of light emitted. Planets are no exception. So maybe
Astrophage looked for Venus’s IR signature. It wouldn’t be as
bright as Mercury’s, but it would be distinct—a different
“color.”
A little googling told me Venus’s average temperature was
462 degrees Celsius.
I had a whole drawer full of replacement bulbs for
microscopes and other lab stuff. I grabbed one and hooked it up
to a variable power supply. Incandescent bulbs work by getting
the filament so hot it emits visible light. That happens around
2,500 degrees Celsius. I didn’t need anything so dramatic. I just
needed a measly 462 degrees. I adjusted power going through
the bulb up and down, watching with an IR camera, until I got
exactly the light frequency I wanted.
I moved the whole contraption into my test closet, watched
the monitor with my boys on it, and turned on the artificial
Venus.
Nothing. Absolutely no movement from the little jerks.
“What do you want from me?!” I demanded.
I pulled my goggles off and threw them to the ground. I
drummed my fingers on the table. “If I were an astronomer, and
someone showed me a blob of light, how would I know if it’s
Venus?”
I answered myself. “I’d look for that IR signature! But that’s
not what Astrophage does. Okay, someone shows me a blob of
light and says I’m not allowed to use emitted IR to work out the
temperature of the body. How else could I find out if it’s
Venus?”
Spectroscopy. Look for carbon dioxide.
I raised an eyebrow as the idea came to me.
When light hits gas molecules, the electrons get all worked
up. Then they calm down and re-emit the energy as light. But
the frequency of the photons they emit is very specific to the
molecules involved. Astronomers used this for decades to know
what gases are out there far, far away. That’s what spectroscopy
is all about.
Venus’s atmosphere is ninety times Earth’s pressure and
almost entirely carbon dioxide. Its spectroscopy signature of
CO2 would be overwhelmingly strong. Mercury had no carbon
dioxide at all, so the nearest competitor would be Earth. But we
had a minuscule CO2
signature compared to Venus. Maybe
Astrophage used emission spectra to find Venus?
New plan!
The lab had a seemingly infinite supply of light filters. Pick a
frequency, and there’s a filter for it. I looked up the spectral
signature of carbon dioxide—the peak wavelengths were 4.26
microns and 18.31 microns.
I found the appropriate filters and built a little box for them.
Inside I put a small white lightbulb. Now I had a box that would
emit the spectral signature of carbon dioxide.
I put it in the test closet and went out to watch the monitor.
Larry, Curly, and Moe hung out on their slide, just like they had
all day long.
I flicked on the light box and watched for any reaction.
The Astrophage left. They didn’t just meander toward the
light. They were gone. Absolutely gone.
“Um…”
I had been recording the camera input, of course. I ran it
back to watch frame by frame. Between two frames they simply
disappeared.
“Um!”
Good news: Astrophage were attracted to carbon dioxide’s
spectral signature!
Bad news: My three irreplaceable, 10-micron-wide
Astrophage had launched off somewhere—maybe at velocities
approaching the speed of light—and I had no idea where they
went.
“Craaaaaap.”
—
Midnight. Darkness everywhere. The army guys changed shift
to two guys I didn’t know. I missed Steve.
I had aluminum foil and duct tape up over every window of
the lab. I sealed the cracks around the entrances and exits with
electrical tape. I turned off every piece of equipment that had a
readout or LED of any kind. I put my watch in a drawer
because it had glow-in-the-dark paint on the hands.
I let my eyes adjust to the total darkness. If I saw so much as
a single shape that wasn’t my imagination, I sought out the light
leak and put tape over it. Finally, I reached a level of darkness
so intense I couldn’t see anything. Opening or closing my eyes
had no effect at all.
The next step was my newly invented IR goggles.
The lab had many things, but infrared goggles were not
among them. I’d considered asking Steve the army guy if he
could score some. I probably could have called Stratt and she
would have had the president of Peru personally deliver them or
something. But this was faster.
The “goggles” were just the LCD output screen of my IR
camera with a bunch of tape around them. I pressed them to my
face and added more tape. Then more and more and more. I’m
sure I looked ridiculous. But whatever.
I fired up the camera and looked around the lab. Plenty of
heat signatures. The walls were still warm from sunlight earlier
that day, everything electrical had a glow, and my body shined
like a beacon. I adjusted the frequency range to look for much
hotter things. Specifically, things over 90 degrees Celsius.
I crawled into my makeshift microscope closet and looked at
the light box I’d used for the CO2
 spectral emission.
Astrophage are only 10 microns across. No chance I’d see
something so small with the camera (or with my eyes, for that
matter). But my little aliens are very hot, and they stay hot. So,
if they’re not moving, they will have spent the last six hours or
so slowly heating up their surroundings. That was the hope.
It panned out. I immediately saw a circle of light on one of
the plastic light filters.
“Oh thank God,” I gasped.
It was very faint but it was there. The spot was about 3
millimeters across and grew fainter and colder away from the
center. The little fella had been heating up the plastic for hours.
I scanned back and forth across the two plastic squares. I
quickly found a second spot.
My experiment worked way better than I expected. They saw
what they thought was Venus and beelined for it. When they hit
the light filters, they couldn’t go any farther. They probably kept
pushing until I turned off the light.
Anyway, if I could just confirm that all three Astrophage
were present, I could bag the filters, then spend however long I
needed to find and harvest the boys from them with a
microscope and pipette.
And there it was. The third Astrophage.
“The gang’s all here!” I said. I reached into my pocket for a
sample bag and got ready to very carefully pull the filter off the
light box. That’s when I saw the fourth Astrophage.
Just…minding its own business. A fourth cell. It was right in
the same general cluster as the first three, on the filters.
“Holy…”
I’d been staring at these guys for a week. There’s no way I
would have missed one. There could only be one explanation:
One of the Astrophage divided. I’d accidentally made the
Astrophage reproduce.
I stared at that fourth spot of light for a full minute, taking in
the magnitude of what had just happened. Breeding Astrophage
meant we would have an unlimited supply for study. Kill them,
poke them, take them apart, do whatever we wanted. This was a
game changer.
“Hello, Shemp,” I said.
—
I spent the next two days obsessively studying this new behavior.
I didn’t even go home—I just slept in the lab.
Steve the army guy brought me breakfast. Great guy.
I should have shared all my findings with the rest of the
science community, but I wanted to be sure. Peer review may
have fallen by the wayside, but at least I could self-review.
Better than nothing.
The first thing that bothered me: CO2
spectral emissions are
4.26 and 18.31 microns. But Astrophage are only 10 microns
across, so it couldn’t really interact with light that had a larger
wavelength. How could it even see the 18.31 micron band?
I repeated my earlier spectral experiment with just the 18.31
micron filter and got a result I didn’t expect. Strange things
happened.
First off, two of the Astrophage whipped over to the filter.
They saw the light and went right for it. But how? It should be
impossible for Astrophage to interact with a wavelength that
big. I mean…literally impossible!
Light is a funny thing. Its wavelength defines what it can and
can’t interact with. Anything smaller than the wavelength is
functionally nonexistent to that photon. That’s why there’s a
mesh over the window of a microwave. The holes in the mesh
are too small for microwaves to pass through. But visible light,
with a much shorter wavelength, can go through freely. So you
get to watch your food cook without melting your face off.
Astrophage is smaller than 18.31 microns but somehow still
absorbs light at that frequency. How?
But that’s not even the strangest thing that happened. Yes, two
of them took off for the filter, but the other two stayed put.
They didn’t seem to care. They just hung out on the slide.
Maybe they didn’t interact with the larger wavelength?
So I did one more experiment. I shined the 4.26 micron light
at them again. And I got the same results. The same two went
right for the filter as before, and the other two just didn’t care.
And there it was. I couldn’t be 100 percent certain, but I was
pretty sure I’d just discovered the whole Astrophage life-cycle.
It clicked in my mind like puzzle pieces finally fitting together.
The two holdouts didn’t want to go to Venus anymore. They
wanted to go back to the sun. Why? Because one of them just
divided and created the other.
Astrophage hang out on the surface of the sun gathering
energy via heat. They store it internally in some way no one
understands. Then, when they have enough, they migrate to
Venus to breed, using that stored energy to fly through space
using infrared light as a propellant. Lots of species migrate to
breed. Why would Astrophage be any different?
The Aussies already worked out that the inside of Astrophage
wasn’t much different from Earth life. It needed carbon and
oxygen to make the complex proteins required for DNA,
mitochondria, and all the other fun stuff found in cells. There’s
plenty of hydrogen on the sun. But the other elements just aren’t
present. So Astrophage migrates to the nearest supply of carbon
dioxide: Venus.
First, it follows magnetic field lines and goes straight away
from the sun’s North Pole. It has to do that, or the light from the
sun would be too blinding to find Venus. And going straight up
from the pole means the Astrophage will have a full view of
Venus’s entire orbital path—no portion of it occluded by the
sun.
Ah, and that’s why Astrophage is so inconsistent on reacting
to magnetic fields. It only cares about them at the very
beginning of its journey and at no other time.
Then it looks for Venus’s massive carbon dioxide spectral
signature. Well, not really “looks for.” It’s probably more a
simple stimulus-response thing initiated by the 4.26 and 18.31
micron light bands. Anyway, once it “sees” Venus, it goes
straight to it. The path it takes—straight away from the solar
pole, then sharply turning toward Venus—that’s the Petrova
line.
Our heroic Astrophage reaches the upper atmosphere of
Venus, collects the CO2
it needs, and can finally reproduce.
After that, both parent and child return to the sun and the cycle
begins anew.
It’s simple, really. Get energy, get resources, and make
copies. It’s the same thing all life on Earth does.
And that was why two of my little Stooges didn’t walk toward
the light.
So how does Astrophage find the sun? My guess: Look for
the extremely bright thing and head that way.
I separated Moe and Shemp (the sun-seekers) from Larry and
Curly (the Venus-seekers). I put Larry and Curly on a different
slide and put it in a light-sealed sample container. Then I set up
an experiment in the dark closet for Moe and Shemp. This time,
I put a bright incandescent bulb in there and turned it on. I
expected them to head right toward it, but no dice. They didn’t
budge. Probably not bright enough.
I went to a photography store downtown (San Francisco has a
lot of photography enthusiasts) and bought the largest, brightest,
most powerful flash I could find. I replaced the lightbulb with
the flash and did the experiment again.
Moe and Shemp took the bait!
I had to sit down and take a breath. I should have taken a nap
—I hadn’t slept in thirty-six hours. But this was too exciting. I
pulled out my cell phone and dialed Stratt’s number. She
answered halfway through the first ring.
“Dr. Grace,” she said. “Find something?”
“Yeah,” I said. “I figured out how Astrophage reproduce and
managed to make it happen.”
Silence for a second. “You successfully bred Astrophage?”
“Yes.”
“Nondestructively?” she asked.
“I had three cells. I now have four. They’re all alive and well.”
Silence for another second. “Stay there.”
She hung up.
“Huh,” I said. I put the phone back in my lab coat. “Guess
she’s on her way.”
Steve the army guy burst into the lab. “Dr. Grace?!”
“Wha…uh, yeah?”
“Please come with me.”
“Okay,” I said. “Let me just get my Astrophage samples put
away—”
“There are lab techs on the way to deal with all that. You
have to come with me now.”
“O-Okay…”
—
The next twelve hours were…unique.
Steve the army guy drove me to a high school football field
where a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter had already landed.
Without words, they hustled me into the chopper and up we
went into the sky. I tried not to look down.
The chopper took me to Travis Air Force Base, about 60
miles north of the city. Did the marines often land at air force
bases? I don’t know much about the military, but that seemed
odd. It also seemed a bit extreme to send in the marines just to
keep me from driving through a couple of hours of traffic, but
okay.
There was a jeep waiting for me on the tarmac where the
helicopter landed, with an air force guy standing next to it. He
introduced himself, I swear he did, but I don’t remember his
name.
He drove me across the tarmac to a waiting jet. No, not a
passenger jet. And not a Learjet or anything like that. This was
a fighter jet. I don’t know what kind. Like I said, I don’t know
military stuff.
My guide hustled me up a ladder and into the seat behind the
pilot. He gave me a pill and a little paper cup of water. “Take
this.”
“What is it?”
“It’ll keep you from puking all over our nice, clean cockpit.”
“Okay.”
I swallowed the pill.
“And it’ll help you sleep.”
“What?”
Away he went, and the ground crew pulled away the ladder.
The pilot didn’t say a word to me. Ten minutes later, we took
off like a bat out of hell. I’d never felt acceleration like that in
my life. The pill did its job. I definitely would have puked.
“Where are we going?” I asked through the headset.
“I’m sorry, sir. I’m not allowed to speak to you.”
“This is going to be a boring trip, then.”
“They usually are,” he said.
I don’t know exactly when I fell asleep but it was within
minutes of taking off. Thirty-six hours of mad science plus
whatever was in that pill put me right into dreamland regardless
of the ridiculous jet-engine noise surrounding me.
I awoke in darkness to a jolt. We’d landed.
“Welcome to Hawaii, sir,” said the pilot.
“Hawaii? Why am I in Hawaii?”
“I wasn’t given that information.”
The jet taxied onto some side runway or whatever and a
ground crew brought a ladder. I hadn’t gotten halfway down the
ladder yet when I heard “Dr. Grace? This way, please!”
It was a man in a U.S. Navy uniform.
“Where the hell am I?!” I demanded.
“Naval Station Pearl Harbor,” said the officer. “But not for
long. Please follow me.”
“Sure. Why not?”
They put me in another jet with another non-talkative pilot.
The only difference was that this time it was a navy jet instead
of an air force jet.
We flew for a long time. I lost track of the hours. Keeping
track was meaningless anyway. I didn’t know how long we’d be
in the air. Finally, I kid you not, we landed on an honest-to-God
aircraft carrier.
Next thing I knew, I was on the flight deck looking like an
idiot. They gave me earmuffs and a coat and shuffled me over to
a helipad. A navy chopper was waiting for me.
“Will this trip…end? Like…ever?!” I asked.
They ignored me and got me strapped in. The chopper took
off immediately. This time, the flight wasn’t nearly so long. Just
an hour or so.
“This should be interesting,” said the pilot. It was the only
thing he’d said the whole flight.
We descended and the landing gear deployed. Below us was
another aircraft carrier. I squinted at it. Something looked
different. What was it…oh, right. It had a big Chinese flag flying
over it.
“Is that a Chinese aircraft carrier?!” I asked.
“Yes, sir.”
“Are we, a U.S. Navy helicopter, going to land on that
Chinese aircraft carrier?”
“Yes, sir.”
“I see.”
We landed on the carrier’s helipad and a bunch of Chinese
Navy guys watched us with interest. There would be no postflight servicing of this chopper. My pilot leered through the
windows at them and they leered right back.
As soon as I stepped out, he took off again. I was in China’s
hands now.
A navy man came forward and gestured for me to follow him.
I don’t think anyone spoke English, but I got the general idea.
He led me to a door in the tower structure and we went inside.
We wound through passageways, stairwells, and rooms I didn’t
even understand the purpose of. All the while, Chinese sailors
watched me with curiosity.
Finally, he stopped at a door with Chinese characters on it.
He opened the door and pointed inside. I walked in and he
slammed the door behind me. So much for my guide.
I think it was an officer’s conference room. At least, that was
my assumption based on the big table with fifteen people sitting
at it. They all turned their heads to look up at me. Some were
white, some were black, some were Asian. Some wore lab coats.
Others wore suits.
Stratt, of course, sat at the head of the table. “Dr. Grace.
How was your trip?”
“How was my trip?” I said. “I got dragged across the goshdarned world without any notice—”
She held up her hand. “It was just a pleasantry, Dr. Grace. I
don’t actually care how your trip was.” She stood and addressed
the room. “Ladies and gentlemen, this is Dr. Ryland Grace from
the United States. He figured out how to breed Astrophage.”
Gasps came from around the table. One man shot to his feet
and spoke with a thick German accent. “Are you serious? Stratt,
warum haben sie—?”
“Nur Englisch,” Stratt interrupted.
“Why are we only hearing of this now?” the German
demanded.
“I wanted to confirm it first. While Dr. Grace was en route, I
had technicians pack up his lab. They collected four live
Astrophage from his lab. I only left him three.”
An elderly man in a lab coat spoke Japanese in a calm,
soothing voice. Next to him, a younger Japanese man in a
charcoal suit translated. “Dr. Matsuka would like to respectfully
request a detailed description of the process.”
Stratt stepped aside and gestured to her chair. “Doctor, have a
seat and lay it out for us.”
“Hold on,” I said. “Who are these people? Why am I on a
Chinese aircraft carrier? And have you ever heard of Skype?!”
“This is an international body of high-level scientists and
political operatives that I have assembled to spearhead Project
Hail Mary.”
“What’s that?”
“That would take a while to explain. Everyone here is eager to
hear about your Astrophage findings. Let’s start with that.”
I shuffled to the front of the room and sat awkwardly at the
head of the table. All eyes turned to me.
So I told them. I told them all about the wooden closet
experiments. I explained all my tests, what I did for each one,
and how I did them. Then I explained my conclusions: I told
them my hypothesis about the Astrophage life-cycle, how it
works, and why. There were a few questions from the assembled
scientists and politicos, but mostly they just listened and took
notes. Several had translators whispering in their ear during the
process.
“So…yeah,” I said. “That’s pretty much everything. I mean—
it’s not rigorously tested yet but it seems pretty simple.”
German Guy raised his hand. “Would it be possible to breed
Astrophage on a large scale?”
Everyone leaned forward a little. Apparently this was a pretty
important question and it was on everyone’s mind. I was taken
aback by the sudden intensity of the room.
Even Stratt seemed unusually interested. “Well?” she said.
“Please answer Minister Voigt.”
“Sure,” I said. “I mean…why not?”
“How would you do it?” asked Stratt.
“I guess I’d make a big elbow-shaped ceramic pipe and fill it
with carbon dioxide. Make one end of it as hot as you can get it
and have a bright light there. Wrap a magnetic coil around it to
simulate the magnetic field of the sun. Put an IR light emitter at
the other end of the elbow and have it emit light at 4.26 and
18.31 microns. Make the inside of the pipe as black as you can.
That should do it.”
“How does that ‘do it’?” she said.
I shrugged. “The Astrophage will gather energy at the ‘sun’
side and when they’re ready to breed, they’ll follow that
magnetic field to the pipe’s elbow. They’ll see the IR light at the
other end and head toward it. Seeing that light and being
exposed to carbon dioxide makes them breed. Then the parent
and daughter cells will go back to the sun side. Simple enough.”
A political-looking man raised his hand and spoke with some
kind of African accent. “How much Astrophage could be made
this way? How fast is the process?”
“It would have a doubling time,” I said. “Like algae or
bacteria. I don’t know how long it is, but considering the sun is
getting dim it must be pretty quick.”
A woman in a lab coat had been on her phone. She set it
down, then spoke with a thick Chinese accent. “Our scientists
have reproduced your results.”
Minister Voigt scowled at her. “How did you even know his
process? He just told us!”
“Spies, presumably,” said Stratt.
The German huffed. “How dare you circumvent us with—”
“Shush,” said Stratt. “We’re past all that. Ms. Xi, do you have
any additional information to share?”
“Yes,” she said. “We estimate the doubling time to be just
over eight days, under optimal conditions.”
“What does that mean?” the African diplomat said. “How
much can we make?”
“Well.” I launched my phone’s calculator app and tapped a
few buttons. “If you started with the one hundred and fifty
Astrophage we have, and bred them for a year, at the end of it
you’d have…about 173,000 kilograms of Astrophage.”
“And would this Astrophage be at maximum energy density?
Would it all be ready to reproduce?”
“So you want…I guess you’d call it ‘enriched’ Astrophage?”
“Yes,” he said. “That’s a perfect word for it. We want
Astrophage that is holding as much energy as it can.”
“Uh…I guess that could be arranged,” I said. “First, breed up
the number of Astrophage you want, then expose them to lots of
heat energy but don’t let them see any carbon dioxide spectral
lines. They’ll collect energy and just sort of sit there waiting
until they can see somewhere to get CO2
.”
“What if we needed two million kilograms of enriched
Astrophage?” said the diplomat.
“It’s doubling every eight days,” I said. “Two million kilos
would be another four doublings or so. So, one month longer.”
A woman leaned forward on the table, her fingers steepled.
“We might just have a chance.” She had an American accent.
“An outside chance,” said Voigt.
“There is hope,” said the Japanese translator—presumably
speaking for Dr. Matsuka.
“We need to talk amongst ourselves,” said Stratt. “Go get
some rest. The sailor outside will show you to a bunk.”
“But I want to know about Project Hail Mary!”
“Oh, you will. Believe me.”
—
I slept for fourteen hours.
Aircraft carriers are awesome in many ways, but they aren’t
five-star hotels. The Chinese had given me a clean, comfy cot in
an officer’s bunkroom. I had no complaints. I could have slept
on the flight deck I was so tired.
I felt something weird on my forehead when I woke up. I
reached up and it was a Post-it note. Someone put a Post-it on
my head while I slept. I pulled it off and read it:
Clean clothes and toiletries in the duffel under your bunk. Show this note to
any sailor when you’ve cleaned up: 请带我去甲板7的官员会议室
—Stratt
“She is such a pain in my butt…” I mumbled.
I stumbled out of my cot. A few officers gave me passing
glances but otherwise ignored me. I found the duffel and, as
promised, there were clothes and dental-hygiene stuff and soap.
I glanced around the bunkroom and saw through a doorway into
a locker room.
I used the bathroom (or “head” I guess, because I was on a
ship). Then I took a shower with three other guys. I dried off
and put on the jumpsuit onesie Stratt had left me. It was bright
yellow, had Chinese writing along the back, and a big red stripe
down the left leg of the pants. My guess was to make sure
everyone knew I was a foreign civilian and not allowed in
certain places.
I flagged down a passing sailor and showed him the note. He
nodded and gestured for me to follow. He led me through a
maze of twisty little passages, all alike, until we arrived back at
the room I’d been in the previous day.
I stepped in to see Stratt and some of her…teammates? A
subset of the previous day’s gang. Just Minister Voigt, the
Chinese scientist—I think her name was Xi—and a guy in a
Russian military uniform. The Russian had been there the
previous day but hadn’t said anything. They all looked deep in
concentration and the table was littered with paper. They
mumbled to one another here and there. I didn’t know the exact
relationships going on, but Stratt was definitely at the head of
the table.
She looked up as I entered.
“Ah. Dr. Grace. You look refreshed.” She gestured to her left.
“There’s food on the credenza.”
And there was! Rice, steamed buns, deep-fried dough sticks,
and an urn of coffee. I rushed over and helped myself. I was
hungry as heck.
I sat at the conference table with a full plate and cup of
coffee.
“So,” I said with a mouth full of rice. “You gonna tell me why
we’re on a Chinese aircraft carrier?”
“I needed an aircraft carrier. The Chinese gave me one. Well,
they lent it to me.”
I slurped my coffee. “There was a time when something like
that would surprise me. But…you know…not anymore.”
“Commercial air travel takes too long and is prone to delays,”
she said. “Military aircraft work on whatever schedule they want
and travel supersonically. I need to be able to get experts from
anywhere on Earth in the same room with no delays.”
“Ms. Stratt can be extremely persuasive,” said Minister Voigt.
I shoveled more food into my mouth. “Blame whoever gave
her all that authority,” I said.
Voigt chuckled. “I was part of that decision, actually. I am
Germany’s minister of foreign affairs. The equivalent of your
country’s secretary of state.”
I paused my chewing. “Wow,” I managed to say. I gulped
down the mouthful. “You’re the most high-ranking person I’ve
ever met.”
“No, I’m not.” He pointed to Stratt.
She put a piece of paper in front of me. “This is what led to
the Hail Mary Project.”
“You’re showing him?” Voigt said. “Now? Without getting
him a clearance—”
Stratt put her hand on my shoulder. “Dr. Ryland Grace, I
hereby grant you top-secret clearance to all information
pertaining to Project Hail Mary.”
“That’s not what I meant,” Voigt said. “There are processes
and background checks to—”
“No time,” Stratt said. “No time for any of that stuff. That’s
why you put me in charge. Speed.”
She turned toward me and tapped the paper: “These are
readings from amateur astronomers all over the world. They
show something very important.”
The page had columns of numbers. I noticed the column
titles: “Alpha Centauri,” “Sirius,” “Luyten 726-8,” and so on.
“Stars?” I said. “These are all stars in our local cluster. And
wait—did you say amateur astronomers? If you can tell the
German minister of foreign affairs what to do, why don’t you
have professional astronomers working for you?”
“I do,” Stratt said. “But this is historical data collected over
the past several years. Professional astronomers don’t study local
stars. They look at faraway things. It’s the amateurs who log
data on local stuff. Like train spotters. Hobbyists in their
backyards. Some of them with tens of thousands of dollars’
worth of equipment.”
I picked up the paper. “Okay, so what am I looking at?”
“Luminosity readings. Normalized across thousands of
amateur-generated data sets and corrected for known weather
and visibility conditions. Supercomputers were involved. The
point is this: Our sun is not the only star that’s getting dimmer.”
“Really?” I said. “Ohhh! That makes perfect sense!
Astrophage can travel at 0.92 times the speed of light. If it can
go dormant and stay alive long enough, it could infect nearby
stars. It spores! Just like mold! It spreads from star to star.”
“That’s our theory, yes,” said Stratt. “This data goes back
decades. It’s not deeply reliable but the trends are there. The
NSA back-calculated that—”
“Wait. NSA? The U.S. National Security Agency?”
“They have some of the best supercomputers in the world. I
needed their supercomputers and engineers to try all kinds of
scenarios and propagation models for how Astrophage could get
around in the galaxy. Back to the point: These local stars have
been dimming for decades. And the rate of dimming increases
exponentially—just like we’re seeing with the sun.”
She handed me another piece of paper. It had a bunch of dots
connected by lines. Above each dot was a star name. “Owing to
the speed of light, our observations of the dimming had to be
adjusted for the distances of the stars and whatnot, but there’s a
clear pattern of ‘infection’ from star to star. We know when each
star was infected and by which infected star. Our sun was
infected by a star called WISE 0855–0714. That star was
infected by Sirius, which was infected by Epsilon Eridani. From
there, the trail goes cold.”
I peered at the chart. “Huh. WISE 0855–0714 also infected
Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, and Ross 128.”
“Yes, every star eventually infects all of its neighbors. Judging
from our data, we think Astrophage has a maximum range of
just under eight light-years. Any star within that range of an
infected star will eventually be infected.”
I looked at the data. “Why eight light-years? Why not more?
Or less?”
“Our best guess is the Astrophage can only survive so long
without a star and it can coast about eight light-years in that
time.”
“That’s sensible, from an evolution point of view,” I said.
“Most stars have another star within eight light-years, so that’s
as far as Astrophage had to evolve to travel while sporing.”
“Probably,” Stratt said.
“Nobody noticed those stars getting dimmer?” I said.
“They only get to about ten percent dimmer before they stop
dimming. We don’t know why. It’s not obvious to the naked eye,
but—”
“But if our sun dims by ten percent, we’re all dead,” I said.
“Pretty much.”
Xi leaned forward on the table. Her posture was extremely
proper. “Ms. Stratt has not told you the most important part
yet.”
The Russian nodded. It was the first time I’d seen him move
at all.
Xi continued. “Do you know what Tau Ceti is?”
“Do I know?” I said. “I mean—I know it’s a star. It’s about
twelve light-years away, I think.”
“Eleven point nine,” said Xi. “Very good. Most would not
know that.”
“I teach junior high school science,” I said. “These things
come up.”
Xi and the Russian shot each other surprised looks. Then they
both looked at Stratt.
Stratt stared them down. “There’s more to him than that.”
Xi regained her composure (not that she’d lost much of it
anyway). “Ahem. In any event, Tau Ceti is very much inside the
cluster of infected stars. In fact, it is near the center.”
“Okay,” I said. “I’m sensing there’s something special about
it?”
“It is not infected,” Xi said. “Every star around it is. There
are two very infected stars well within eight light-years of Tau
Ceti, yet it remains unaffected.”
“Why?”
Stratt shuffled through her papers. “That’s what we want to
find out. So we’re going to make a ship and send it there.”
I snorted. “You can’t just ‘make’ an interstellar ship. We don’t
have the technology. We don’t have anything close to the
technology.”
The Russian spoke for the first time. “Actually, my friend, we
do.”
Stratt gestured to the Russian. “Dr. Komorov is—”
“Please call me Dimitri,” he said.
“Dimitri heads up the Russian Federation’s research into
Astrophage,” she said.
“It is pleasure to meet you,” he said. “I am happy to report
that we can actually make interstellar voyage.”
“No, we can’t,” I said. “Unless you’ve got an alien spaceship
you never told anyone about.”
“In a way, we do,” he said. “We have many alien spaceships.
We call them Astrophage. You see? My group has studied the
energy management of Astrophage. It is very interesting.”
I suddenly forgot everything else going on in the room. “Oh
God, please tell me you understand where the heat goes. I can’t
figure out what the heck it’s doing with the heat energy!”
“We have figured this out, yes,” said Dimitri. “With lasers. It
was very illuminating experiment.”
“Was that a pun?”
“It was!”
“Good one!”
We both laughed. Stratt glared at us.
Dimitri cleared his throat. “Er…yes. We pointed tight-focus
one-kilowatt laser at a single Astrophage cell. As usual, it did
not get hotter. But after twenty-five minutes, light starts to
bounce off. Our little Astrophage is full. Good meal. It
consumed 1.5 megajoules of light energy. Does not want more.
But this is very much energy! Where does it put all this
energy?”
I’m leaning way too far forward over the table, but I can’t help
myself. “Where?!”
“We measure Astrophage cell before and after experiment, of
course.”
“Of course.”
“Astrophage cell is now seventeen nanograms heavier. You
can see where this goes, yes?”
“No, it can’t be. It must have gained that weight from
reactions with the air or something.”
“No, it was in a vacuum for the test, of course.”
“Oh my God.” I was giddy. “Seventeen nanograms…times
nine times ten to the sixteenth…1.5 megajoules!”
I flopped back into my chair. “Holy…I mean just…wow!”
“This was how I felt, yes.”
Mass conversion. As the great Albert Einstein once said: E =
mc
2
. There’s an absurd amount of energy in mass. A modern
nuclear plant can power an entire city for a year with the energy
stored in just one kilogram of Uranium. Yes. That’s it. The
entire output of a nuclear reactor for a year comes from a single
kilogram of mass.
Astrophage can, apparently, do this in either direction. It
takes heat energy and somehow turns it into mass. Then when it
wants the energy back, it turns that mass back into energy—in
the form of Petrova-frequency light. And it uses that to propel
itself along in space. So not only is it a perfect energy-storage
medium, it’s a perfect spaceship engine.
Evolution can be insanely effective when you leave it alone for
a few billion years.
I rub my head. “This is just crazy. In a good way, though. Is it
internally producing antimatter, you think? Something like
that?”
“We do not know. But it definitely increases in mass. And
then, after using light as thrust, it loses mass appropriate to
energy released.”
“That’s…! Dimitri, I want to hang out with you. Like—can
we hang out? I’ll buy you a beer. Or vodka. Or anything. I bet
there’s an officers’ club on this boat, right?”
“It would be my pleasure.”
“Glad you’re making friends,” said Stratt. “But you’ve got a
lot of work to do before you start hitting the bars.”
“Me? What do I have to do?”
“You need to design and create an Astrophage-breeding
facility.”
I blinked. Then I shot to my feet. “You’re going to make an
Astrophage-powered ship!”
They all nodded.
“Holy cow! It’s the most efficient rocket fuel ever! How much
would we need to—oh. Two million kilograms, right? That’s
why you wanted to know how long it would take to make that
much?”
“Yes,” said Xi. “For a one hundred thousand kilogram ship,
we would need two million kilograms of Astrophage to get it to
Tau Ceti. And, thanks to you, we now know how to activate the
Astrophage and make it generate thrust at will.”
I sat back down, pulled out my phone, and launched the
calculator app. “This would take, like…a lot of energy. Like,
more energy than the world has. It would be around ten to the
twenty-third Joules. The largest nuclear reactor on Earth makes
about eight gigawatts. It would take that reactor two million
years to create that much energy.”
“We have ideas for finding the energy,” said Stratt. “Your job
is to make the breeder. Start small and get a prototype going.”
“Okay, sure,” I said. “But I didn’t exactly love the ‘militaries
of the world’ grand tour on the way here. Can I take a passenger
jet home? Coach is fine.”
“You are home,” said Stratt. “The flight hangar is empty. Just
tell me what you need—including staff—and I’ll make it
happen.”
I looked at the others in the conference room. Xi, Voigt, and
Dimitri all nodded. Yes, this was real. No, Stratt wasn’t kidding.
“Why?!” I demanded. “Why the heck can’t you just be
normal, Stratt?! If you want fast military transport, well, okay,
but why not just work at an air base or something sane people
would do?!”
“Because we’ll be experimenting with a bunch of Astrophage
once we breed it up. And if we accidentally activate even a
couple of kilograms of that stuff, the resulting explosion will be
bigger than the largest nuclear bomb ever made.”
“Tsar Bomba,” said Dimitri. “Made by my country. Fifty
megatons. Boom.”
Stratt continued. “So we’d rather be out in the middle of the
ocean where we won’t eradicate any cities.”
“Oh,” I said.
“And as we get more and more Astrophage, we’ll go further
and further out to sea. Anyway. Head down to the hangar deck.
I have carpenters building accommodations and offices as we
speak. Pick some you like and lay claim.”
“This is our life now,” said Dimitri. “Welcome.”</p>
