  <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
  <p>I came to the meeting on time. At least, I thought I did. The
email said 12:30. But when I got there, everyone was already
seated. And silent. And they were all staring at me.
For the time being, we had a media blackout about the
accident. The whole world was watching this project—their only
hope for salvation. The last thing we needed was for people to
know the primary and backup science specialists were dead. Say
what you will about the Russians, they know how to keep a
secret. All of Baikonur was on lockdown.
The meeting room, a simple trailer the Russians had supplied,
had a great view of the launch pad. I could see the Soyuz
through the window. Old technology, to be sure, but easily the
most reliable launch system ever made.
Stratt and I hadn’t spoken since the night of the explosion.
She suddenly had to head up an ad-hoc disaster inquiry. It
couldn’t wait until later—if the accident was caused by some
procedure or equipment that was going to be on the mission, we
needed to know. I wanted to be involved but she wouldn’t let
me. Someone had to keep dealing with various minor Hail Mary
issues being reported by the ESA team.
Stratt stared right at me. Dimitri fiddled with some papers—
probably a design for a spin-drive improvement. Dr. Lokken,
the fiery Norwegian who designed the centrifuge, drummed her
fingers on the table. Dr. Lamai wore her lab coat as always. Her
team had perfected a fully automated medical robot and she’d
probably be in line for a Nobel Prize someday. If Earth lived
that long. Even Steve Hatch, the crazy Canadian who invented
the beetle probes, was present. He, at least, didn’t look
awkward. He just typed away on a calculator. He didn’t have
papers in front of him. Just the calculator.
Also present were Commander Yáo and Engineer Ilyukhina.
Yáo looked dour as ever, and Ilyukhina had no drink in her
hand.
“Am I late?” I asked.
“No, you’re just in time,” Stratt said. “Have a seat.”
I sat in the only empty chair.
“We think we know what happened at the research center,”
Stratt began. “The whole building is gone, but all their records
were electronic and stored on a server that handles all of
Baikonur. Fortunately, that server is in the Ground Control
Building. Also, DuBois—being DuBois—kept meticulous
notes.”
She pulled out a paper. “According to his digital diary, his
plan for yesterday was to test an extremely rare failure case that
could happen in an Astrophage-powered generator.”
Ilyukhina shook her head. “Should have been me testing this.
I am responsible for ship maintenance. DuBois should have
asked me.”
“What was he testing, exactly?” I asked.
Lokken cleared her throat. “One month ago, JAXA
discovered a possible failure state for the generator. It uses
Astrophage to make heat, which in turn powers a small turbine
with state-change material. Old, reliable technology. It runs on a
tiny amount of Astrophage—just twenty individual cells at a
time.”
“That seems pretty safe,” I said.
“It is. But if the moderator system on the generator’s pump
fails, and there’s an unusually dense clump of Astrophage in the
fuel line right at that moment, up to one nanogram of
Astrophage could be put into the reaction chamber.”
“What would that do?”
“Nothing. Because the generator also controls the amount of
IR light shined on the Astrophage. If the chamber temperature
gets too high, the IR lights turn off to let Astrophage calm
down. Safe backup system. But there is a possible edge case,
extremely unlikely, that a short in this system could make the IR
lights turn on at full power and bypass the temperature safety
interlock entirely. DuBois wanted to test this very, very unlikely
scenario.”
“So what did he do?”
Lokken paused and her lip wobbled a bit. She steeled herself
and pressed on. “He got a replica generator—one of the ones we
use for ground testing. He modified the feed pump and IR lights
to force that crazy edge case to happen. He wanted to activate
an entire nanogram of Astrophage at once and see how it
damaged the generator.”
“Wait,” I said. “One nanogram isn’t enough to blow up a
building. At worst it could melt a little bit of metal.”
“Yeah,” said Lokken. She took a deep breath and let it out
slowly. “So you know how we store tiny quantities of
Astrophage, right?”
“Sure,” I said. “In little plastic containers suspended in
propylene glycol.”
She nodded. “When DuBois requisitioned one nanogram of
Astrophage from the research center’s quartermaster, they gave
him one milligram by mistake. And since the containers are the
same and the quantities are so small, he and Shapiro had no way
of knowing.”
“Oh God.” I rubbed my eyes. “That’s literally a million times
the heat-energy release than they were expecting. It vaporized
the building and everyone in it. God.”
Stratt shuffled her papers. “The simple truth is this: We just
don’t have the procedures or experience to manage Astrophage
safely. If you asked for a firecracker and someone gave you a
truck full of plastic explosive, you’d know something was
wrong. But the difference between a nanogram and a milligram?
Humans just can’t tell.”
We were all silent for a moment. She was right. We’d been
playing around with Hiroshima-bomb levels of energy like it
was nothing. In any other scenario it would have been madness.
But we didn’t have a choice.
“So are we going to delay the launch?” I asked.
“No, we’ve talked it over and we all agree: We can’t delay the
Hail Mary’s departure. It’s assembled, tested, fueled, and ready
to go.”
“It is the orbit,” Dimitri said. “It is in tight orbit at 51.6
degrees’ inclination so Cape Canaveral and Baikonur can get at
it easy. But is also in shallow orbit which is decaying. If it does
not set out within next three weeks, we have to send entire
mission up just to re-boost it to higher orbit.”
“The Hail Mary will leave on schedule,” said Stratt. “Five
days from now. The crew will have two days of preflight checks,
so that means the Soyuz has to launch in three days.”
“Okay,” I said. “What about the science expert? I’m sure we
have hundreds of volunteers all over the world. We can give the
selectee a crash course in the science they’ll need to know—”
“The decision’s been made,” Stratt said. “Really, the decision
made itself. There’s no time to train a specialist in everything
they need to know. There’s just too much information and
research to learn. Even the most brilliant scientists wouldn’t be
able to glean all of it in just three days. And remember, only
about one in seven thousand people have the gene combination
to be coma-resistant.”
Right around then I got a sinking feeling. “I think I see where
this is going.”
“As I’m sure you know by now, your tests came up positive.
You are that one in seven thousand.”
“Welcome to crew!” Ilyukhina said.
“Wait, wait. No.” I shook my head. “This is insane. Sure, I’m
up to speed on Astrophage, but I don’t know anything about
being an astronaut.”
“We will train you as we go.” Yáo spoke quietly, but with
confidence. “And we will do the hard tasks. You will be utilized
only for science.”
“I just mean…come on! There has to be someone else!” I
looked to Stratt. “What about Yáo’s backup? Or Ilyukhina’s?”
“They’re not biologists,” said Stratt. “They’re incredibly
skilled people with a nose-to-tail expertise on the Hail Mary, its
operations, and how to repair damage. But we can’t train
someone in all the cellular biology they need to know in the
time we have. It would be like asking the world’s best structural
engineer to do brain surgery. It’s just not their field.”
“What about other candidates on the list? The ones that didn’t
make the original cut?”
“There’s no one as qualified as you. Frankly, we’re lucky—
lucky beyond our wildest dreams—that you happen to be comaresistant. Do you think I kept you on the project for so long
because I needed a junior high schoolteacher around?”
“Oh…” I said.
“You know how the ship works,” Stratt continued. “You know
the science behind Astrophage. You know how to use an EVA
suit and all the specialized gear. You’ve been present for every
major scientific or strategic discussion we’ve had about the ship
and its mission—I made sure of it. You have the genes we need,
so I made damn sure you had the skills we need. God knows I
didn’t want it to come to this, but here we are. You’ve been the
tertiary science specialist all along.”
“N-No, that can’t be right,” I said. “There’s got to be other
people. Much more talented scientists. And, you know, people
who actually want to go. You must have made a list, right?
Who’s the next candidate after me?”
Stratt picked up a piece of paper in front of her. “Andrea
Cáceres, a distillery worker from Paraguay. She’s comaresistant, and holds a bachelor’s degree in chemistry with a
minor in cellular biology. And she volunteered for the mission
back during the first call for astronauts.”
“Sounds great,” I said. “Let’s give her a call.”
“But you’ve had years of direct training. You know the ship
and the mission inside and out. And you’re a world-leading
expert on Astrophage. We’d only have a few days to get Cáceres
up to speed. You know how I operate, Dr. Grace. More than
anyone else. I want to give Hail Mary every possible advantage.
And right now, that’s you.”
I looked down at the table. “But I…I don’t want to die….”
“Nobody does,” said Stratt.
“It must be your decision,” said Yáo. “I will not have
someone on my crew who is there against their will. You must
come of your own volition. And if you refuse, we will bring in
Ms. Cáceres and do our best to train her up. But I urge you to
say yes. Billions of lives are on the line. Our lives matter little
when compared against such tragedy.”
I put my head in my hands. The tears started to come. Why
did this have to happen to me? “Can I think about it?”
“Yes,” Stratt said. “But not for very long. If you say no, we
have to get Cáceres here in a hurry. I want your answer by five
.. tonight.”
I stood and shuffled out of the room. I don’t think I even said
goodbye. It’s a dark and depressing feeling to have all your
closest colleagues get together and decide you should die.
I checked my watch—12:38 .. I had four and a half hours
to decide.
—
The spin drives of the Hail Mary are incredibly overpowered for
its current mass. When we left Earth, the ship weighed 2.1
million kilograms—most of it being fuel. Now the ship only
weighs 120,000 kilograms. About one-twentieth its departure
weight.
Thanks to the Hail Mary’s relatively low mass, the scrappy
little beetles are able to collectively give me 1.5  g’s of thrust.
Except that the ship wasn’t designed to have a bunch of thrust
coming in at 45-degree-angle force pushing arbitrary EVA
handles on the hull. If we fire up the beetles at full power, they’ll
just rip free of the handles and ride off into the Tauset.
Rocky was mindful of that when he zeroed out our rotation.
Now we have that under control and I can do EVAs in zero g
like God intended. I 3-D print a model of the Hail Mary’s
internal skeleton and give it to Rocky for his perusal. In under
an hour, he not only has a solution but has fabricated the
xenonite struts to implement it.
So I do another EVA. I add the xenonite supports to the
beetles. For once, everything goes according to plan. Rocky
assures me that the ship can now handle full thrust from the
beetles and I don’t doubt him for a second. The guy knows
engineering.
I type in a bunch of calculations into a complicated Excel
spreadsheet that’s probably got errors in it somewhere. It takes
me six hours to put together. I finally come up with what I think
is the right answer. At least, it should put us close enough that
we can see the Blip-A. Then we can fine-tune our vectors from
there.
“Ready?” I say from the pilot seat.
“Ready,” Rocky says in his bulb. He holds the three control
boxes in his hands.
“Okay…John and Paul to 4.5 percent.”
“John and Paul, 4.5 percent, confirmed,” he says.
Sure, Rocky could have made controls for me to use, but this
is better. I have to watch the screen closely and pay attention to
our vectors. Best to have someone give their full attention to the
beetles. Besides, Rocky’s a ship’s engineer. Who better to run
our makeshift engines?
“John and Paul to zero. Ringo to 1.1 percent,” I say.
“John and Paul zero. Ringo 1.1.”
We make numerous tweaks to the thrust vectors bit by bit to
angle the ship roughly the direction I want. We finally achieve
what I hope is the right direction.
“Here goes nothing,” I say. “All ahead full!”
“John, Paul, Ringo 100 percent.”
I’m thrown back into my seat as the ship lurches forward,
with 1.5 g’s of gravity taking over as we accelerate in a straight
line (maybe) toward the Blip-A (hopefully).
“Maintain thrust for three hours,” I say.
“Three hours. I watch engines. You relax.”
“Thanks, but no time for rest. Want to use gravity while I
can.”
“I stay here. Tell me how experiments go.”
“Will do.”
I’m shooting for another eleven-day transfer. It takes 130
kilograms of fuel to make that happen—about a quarter of what
the beetles have aboard (if you include George, who is sitting on
the lab table full of Astrophage). That should give us enough left
over to correct whatever idiotic mistakes I made in my
trajectory math.
We’ll get up to cruising speed in three hours, then we’ll coast
for most of eleven days. I don’t want to deal with spinning up or
spinning down the centrifuge. Yes, it can be done—Rocky
proved it when he zeroed us out before. But it was a delicate
process with lots of guessing and opportunities for spinning out
of control. Or worse—getting the cables tangled up.
So, for the next three hours I have 1.5 g’s to work with. After
that it’ll be zero g for a while. Time to hit the lab.
I climb down the ladder. My arm hurts. But less than it has.
I’ve been changing the bandages every day—or rather, Dr.
Lamai’s medical marvel machine has been doing it. There’s
definitely scarring all over the skin. I’m going to have an ugly
arm and shoulder for the rest of my life. But I think the deeper
layers of skin must have survived. If they hadn’t, I probably
would have died of gangrene by now. Or Lamai’s machine
would have amputated my arm when I wasn’t looking.
It’s been a while since I had to deal with1.5 g’s. My legs don’t
approve. But I’m used to this sort of complaint at this point.
I walk to the main lab table, where the Taumoeba
experiments are still in progress. Every part of them is firmly
mounted to the table. Just in case we have more unexpected
adventures in acceleration. Of course, it’s not like I’m short on
Taumoeba. I have a bunch of them where my fuel used to be.
I check the Venus experiment first. The cooling mechanism
whirs slightly, keeping the inside temperature correct for
Venus’s extreme upper atmosphere. I originally intended to let
the Taumoeba in there incubate for only an hour, but then the
lights went off and we had other priorities. So now it’s been four
days. If nothing else, they’ve had plenty of time to do their
thing.
I gulp. This is an important moment. The small glass slide
inside had a one-cell-thick layer of Astrophage. If the
Taumoeba are alive and dining on Astrophage, light will be able
to get through. The more light I see through that slide, the fewer
Astrophage are still alive on it.
I steel myself, take a deep breath, and look inside.
Jet-black.
My breathing becomes unsteady. I fish a flashlight out of my
pocket and shine it from behind. No light gets through at all. My
heart sinks.
I sidestep over to the Threeworld Taumoeba experiment. I
take a look at the slide in there and see the same thing.
Completely black.
Taumoeba can’t survive Venus or Threeworld’s environment.
Or, at the very least, they aren’t eating. The pit of my stomach
feels like it’s going to melt.
So close! We were so close! We have the answer right here!
Taumoeba! A natural predator to the thing that’s ruining our
worlds! And it’s hearty too. It can survive and thrive in my fuel
tanks, obviously. But not in Venus or Threeworld’s air. Why the
heck not?!
“What you see, question?” Rocky asks.
“Failure,” I say. “Both experiments. The Taumoeba are all
dead.”
I hear Rocky punch the wall. “Anger!”
“All this work! All of it for nothing. Nothing!” I slam my fist
to the table. “I gave up so much for this! I sacrificed so much!”
I hear Rocky’s carapace clunk to the ground in his bulb. A
sign of deep depression.
We’re both quiet for a time; Rocky slumped in his bulb and
me with my face buried in my hands.
Finally, I hear a scrape. It’s Rocky pulling his carapace off
the floor. “We work more,” he says. “We no give up. We work
hard. We are brave.”
“Yeah, I guess so.”
I’m not the right guy for this job. I’m a last-second
replacement because the actually qualified people blew up. But
I’m here. I may not have all the answers, but I’m here. I must
have volunteered, believing at the time that it was a suicide
mission. Doesn’t help Earth, but it’s something.
—
Stratt’s trailer was twice the size of mine. Privileges of rank, I
suppose. Though to be fair, she needed the space. She sat at a
large table covered in papers. I could see at least six different
languages in four different alphabets on the paperwork before
her, but she didn’t seem to have a problem with any of them.
A Russian soldier stood in one corner of the room. Not
exactly at attention, but not relaxed either. There was a chair
next to him, but he’d apparently elected to stand.
“Hello, Dr. Grace,” Stratt said without looking up. She
pointed to the soldier. “That’s Private Meknikov. Even though
we know the explosion was an accident, the Russians aren’t
taking any chances.”
I looked to the soldier. “So he’s here to make sure imaginary
terrorists don’t kill you?”
“Something like that.” She looked up. “So. It’s five o’clock.
Have you made your decision? Are you going to be the Hail
Mary’s science specialist?”
I sat opposite her. I couldn’t meet her gaze. “No.”
She scowled at me. “I see.”
“It’s…you know…the kids. I should stay here for the kids.” I
squirmed in my seat. “Even if the Hail Mary finds the answer,
we’re going to have almost thirty years of misery.”
“Uh-huh,” she said.
“And, um, well, I’m a teacher. I should teach. We need to
raise a strong, solid generation of survivors. Right now we’re
soft. You, me, the whole Western world. We’re the result of
growing up in unprecedented comfort and stability. It’s the kids
of today that’ll have to make the world of tomorrow work. And
they’re going to inherit a mess. I can really do a lot more by
preparing kids for the world that’s to come. I should stay here on
Earth where I’m needed.”
“On Earth,” she repeated. “Where you’re needed.”
“Y-Yeah.”
“As opposed to on the Hail Mary, where you could be
instrumental in solving the entire problem because you’re
completely trained for the task.”
“It’s not like that,” I said. “I mean. It’s a little like that. But
look, I’m no good on a crew. I’m not some intrepid explorer.”
“Oh, I know,” she said. She clenched her fist and looked to
the side for a moment. Then back to me with a burning gaze I’d
never seen before. “Dr. Grace. You’re a coward and you’re full
of shit.”
I winced.
“If you really cared so much about the children, you’d get on
that ship without hesitation. You could save billions of them
from the apocalypse instead of preparing hundreds of them for
it.”
I shook my head. “It’s not about that—”
“Do you think I don’t know you, Dr. Grace?!” she yelled.
“You’re a coward and you always have been. You abandoned a
promising scientific career because people didn’t like a paper
you wrote. You retreated to the safety of children who worship
you for being the cool teacher. You don’t have a romantic
partner in your life because that would mean you might suffer
heartbreak. You avoid risk like the plague.”
I stood up. “Okay, it’s true! I’m afraid! I don’t want to die! I
worked my ass off on this project and I deserve to live! I’m not
going, and that’s final! Get the next person on the list—that
Paraguayan chemist. She wants to go!”
She slammed her fist on the table. “I don’t care who wants to
go. I care who’s most qualified! Dr. Grace, I’m sorry, but you
are going on that mission. I know you’re afraid. I know you don’t
want to die. But you’re going.”
“You’re out of your darn mind. I’m leaving now.” I turned to
the door.
“Meknikov!” she shouted.
The soldier deftly stepped between me and the door.
I turned back to her. “You have got to be kidding.”
“It would have been easier if you’d just said yes.”
“What’s your plan?” I jerked a thumb at the soldier. “Hold
me at gunpoint for four years during the trip?”
“You’ll be in a coma during the trip.”
I tried to dart past Meknikov, but he stopped me with arms of
iron. He wasn’t rough about it. He was just monumentally
stronger than I was. He held me by the shoulders and faced me
toward Stratt.
“This is crazy!” I yelled. “Yáo will never go for this! He
specifically said he doesn’t want anyone on his ship against their
will!”
“Yeah, that was a curveball. He is annoyingly honorable,”
Stratt said.
She picked up a checklist that she’d written in Dutch. “First,
you’re to be held in a cell for the next few days until the launch.
You’ll have no communication with anyone. Right before
launch, you’ll be given a very strong sedative to knock you out
and we’ll load you into the Soyuz.”
“Don’t you think Yáo will be a little suspicious about that?”
“I’ll explain to Commander Yáo and Specialist Ilyukhina that,
due to limited astronaut training, you were worried that you’d
panic during the launch so you elected to be unconscious for it.
Once aboard the Hail Mary, Yáo and Ilyukhina will secure you
into your medical bed and start your coma procedure. They’ll
take care of all the pre-launch prep from there. You’ll wake up
at Tau Ceti.”
The first seeds of panic started to grow. This lunacy might
actually work. “No! You can’t do that! I won’t do it! This is
insane!”
She rubbed her eyes. “Believe it or not, Dr. Grace, I kind of
like you. I don’t respect you very much, but I do think you’re a
fundamentally good man.”
“Easy for you to say when you’re not the one being murdered!
You’re murdering me!” Tears rolled down my face. “I don’t want
to die! Don’t send me off to die! Please!”
She looked pained. “I don’t like this any more than you do,
Dr. Grace. If it’s any consolation, you’ll be hailed as a hero. If
Earth survives this, there’ll be statues of you all over the place.”
“I won’t do it!” I choked on bile. “I’ll sabotage the mission!
You kill me?! Fine! I’ll kill your mission! I’ll scuttle the ship!”
She shook her head. “No, you won’t. That’s a bluff. Like I
said, you’re fundamentally a good man. When you wake up,
you’ll be good and angry. I’m sure Yáo and Ilyukhina will be
pretty mad about what I did to you too. But in the end, you
three will be out there and you’ll do your job. Because humanity
depends on it. I’m ninety-nine percent sure you’ll do the right
thing.”
“Try me!” I screamed. “Go on! Try me! See what happens!”
“But I can’t rely on ninety-nine percent, can I?” She glanced
at her paper again. “I always assumed the American CIA would
have the best interrogation drugs. But did you know it’s actually
the French? It’s true. Their DGSE has perfected a drug that
causes retrograde amnesia that lasts for long periods of time.
Not just hours or days, but weeks. They used it during various
anti-terror operations. It can be handy for a suspect to forget he
was ever interrogated.”
I stared at her in horror. My throat hurt from yelling.
“Your med bed will give you a nice dose of it before you
wake up. You and your crewmates will just assume it’s a side
effect of the coma. Yáo and Ilyukhina will explain the mission
to you and you’ll roll right into getting to work. The French
assure me the drug doesn’t erase trained skills, language, or
anything like that. By the time your amnesia wears off, you guys
might have already sent the beetles back. And if not, my guess
is you’ll be too far invested in the project to give up.”
She nodded to Meknikov. He dragged me out the door and
frog-walked me down the path.
I craned my neck back toward the door and screamed, “You
can’t do this!”
“Just think of the kids, Grace,” she said from the doorway.
“All those kids you’ll be saving. Think of them.”</p>
