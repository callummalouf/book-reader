  <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
  <p>Okay.
I think it’s time I took a long gosh-darned look at these
screens!
How am I in another solar system?! That doesn’t even make
sense! What star is that, anyway?! Oh my God, I am so going to
die!
I hyperventilate for a while.
I remember what I tell my students: If you’re upset, take a
deep breath, let it out, and count to ten. It dramatically reduced
the number of tantrums in my classroom.
I take a breath. “One…two…thr—this isn’t working! I’m
going to die!”
I hold my head in my hands. “Oh God. Where the heck am
I?”
I scour the monitors for anything I can make sense of. There’s
no lack of information—there’s too much. Each screen has a
handy label on the top. “Life Support,” “Airlock Status,”
“Engines,” “Robotics,” “Astrophage,” “Generators,”
“Centrifuge”—wait a minute. Astrophage?
I check the Astrophage panel closely.
REMAINING: 20,906 KG
CONSUMPTION RATE: 6.045 G/S
Far more interesting than those numbers is the diagram below
them. It shows what I assume is the Hail Mary. My first real
overview of what this ship looks like.
The top of the ship is a cylinder with a nose cone at the front.
That’s a rocket shape if ever I saw one. Judging by the tapered,
conical walls of the control room, this must be the very front of
the ship. Beneath me is the lab. On the diagram that room is
labeled “Lab.” Below that is the room I woke up in.
The one with my dead friends.
I sniffle and wipe away a tear. No time for that right now. I
put it out of my head and keep looking at the diagram. That
room is named “Dormitory.” Okay, so this whole diagram lines
up with my experiences. And it’s nice to know the official names
of things. Underneath the dormitory is a much shorter room,
maybe about 1 meter high, named “Storage.” Aha! There must
be a panel in the floor that I missed. I make a mental note to
check that out later.
But there’s more. A lot more. Under the storage area, there’s
an area labeled “Cable Faring.” No idea what that is or why it
exists. Beneath that, the ship fans out and there appear to be
three cylinders the same width as my little area. They’re all side
by side. My guess is they assembled this ship in space and the
largest diameter they could launch was about 4 meters.
The trio of cylinders—I’d estimate they’re 75 percent of the
total ship’s volume—are labeled “Fuel.”
The fuel area is broken up into nine subcylinders. I tap one of
them out of curiosity, and it brings up a screen for that one fuel
bay. It says : 0.000 . It also has a button labeled
“Jettison.”
Well, I’m not sure why I’m here or what these things are all
about, but I definitely don’t want to hit any button labeled
Jettison.
It’s probably not as dramatic as it seems. These are fuel tanks.
If the fuel has been spent, the ship can ditch the tank to reduce
its mass and make the remaining fuel last longer. It’s the same
reason rockets lifting off from Earth have multiple stages.
Interesting that the ship didn’t automatically eject them as
they became empty. I dismiss the window and return to the
main ship map.
Under each of those large fuel zones is a trapezoidal area
labeled “Spin Drive.” I’ve never heard that term before, but
since it’s in the back of the ship and has the word “drive” in its
name, I assume it’s the propulsion system.
Spin drive…spin drive…I close my eyes and try to think
about it….
—
Nothing happens. I can’t call up memories at will. I’m not quite
there yet.
I peer at the diagram more closely. Why is there 20,000
kilograms of Astrophage on this ship? I’ve got a strong
suspicion. It’s the fuel.
And why not? Astrophage can propel itself with light and has
absurd energy-storage capability. It’s had God-knows-how-many
billion years of evolution to get good at it. Just like a horse is
more energy efficient than a truck, Astrophage is more energy
efficient than a spaceship.
Okay, that explains why there’s a buttload of Astrophage on
the ship. It’s fuel. But why put a diagram of the ship on this
screen? That’s like putting a blueprint of a car on its gas gauge.
Interestingly, the diagram doesn’t really care about the rooms.
It doesn’t even show what’s inside them—just a label for each
one and that’s it. However, the diagram is very focused on the
hull and the rear part of the ship.
I see red pipes leading from the fuel areas to the spin drives.
Probably how fuel gets to the engines. But I also see the pipes
all along the hull of the ship. And they cut across the Cable
Faring area. So the Astrophage fuel is mostly in the fuel tank,
but also kept in a shell all around the hull.
Why do that?
Oh, and there are temperature readings all over the place. I
guess temperature is important because the readings are every
few meters along the hull. And every single one of them reads
96.415°.
Hey, I know that temperature. I know that exact temperature!
What do I know it from? Come on, brain…come on…
—
96.415°, read the display.
“Huh,” I said.
“What is it?” Stratt said immediately.
It was my second day in the lab. Stratt still insisted I be the
only person to look at Astrophage—at least for the time being.
She dropped her tablet on the table and came to the
observation-room window. “Something new?”
“Kind of. The ambient temperature of an Astrophage is
96.415 degrees Celsius.”
“That’s pretty hot, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, almost the boiling point of water,” I said. “For
anything living on Earth it would be deadly. But for a thing
that’s comfortable near the sun, who knows?”
“So what’s significant about it?”
“I can’t get them hotter or colder.” I pointed to the
experiment I’d set up in the fume hood. “I put some Astrophage
in ice-cold water for an hour. When I pulled them out, they
were 96.415 degrees Celsius. Then I put some in a lab furnace
at one thousand degrees. Again, after I pulled them out: 96.415
degrees.”
Stratt paced next to the window. “Maybe they have extremely
good insulation?”
“I thought of that, so I did another experiment. I took an
extremely small droplet of water and put a few Astrophage in it.
After a few hours, the whole droplet was 96.415 degrees. The
Astrophage heated up the water, so that means heat energy can
move out of it.”
“What conclusion can you draw?” she asked.
I tried to scratch my head, but the vinyl suit got in the way.
“Well, we know they have a huge amount of energy stored
inside. I’m guessing they use it to maintain body temperature.
Same way you and I do.”
“A warm-blooded microorganism?” she said.
I shrugged. “Looks that way. Hey, how much longer am I
going to be the only person working on this?”
“Until you stop discovering new stuff.”
“One guy alone in a lab? That’s not how science works,” I
said. “There should be hundreds of people all over the world
working on this.”
“You’re not alone in that thought,” she said. “I’ve had three
different heads of state call me today.”
“Then let other scientists in on it!”
“No.”
“Why not?”
She looked away for a moment, then back through the
window at me. “Astrophage is an alien microbe. What if it can
infect humans? What if it’s deadly? What if hazmat suits and
neoprene gloves aren’t enough protection?”
I gasped. “Wait a minute! Am I a guinea pig? I’m a guinea
pig!”
“No, it’s not like that,” she said.
I stared at her.
She stared at me.
I stared at her.
“Okay, it’s exactly like that,” she said.
“Dang it!” I said. “That’s just not cool!”
“Don’t be dramatic,” she said. “I’m just playing it safe.
Imagine what would happen if I sent Astrophage to the most
brilliant minds on the planet and it killed them all. In an instant
we’d lose the very people we need the most right now. I can’t
risk it.”
I scowled. “This isn’t some cheesy movie, Stratt. Pathogens
evolve slowly over time to attack specific hosts. Astrophage has
never even been on Earth before. There’s just no way it can
‘infect’ humans. Besides, it’s been a couple of days and I’m not
dead. So send it out to the real scientists.”
“You are a real scientist. And you’re making progress as fast
as anyone else would. There’s no point in me risking other lives
while you’re getting it done on your own.”
“Are you kidding?” I said. “With a couple hundred minds
working on this, we’d make a lot more progress on—”
“Also, most deadly diseases have a minimum of least three
days of incubation time.”
“Ah, there it is.”
She walked back to her table and picked up her tablet. “The
rest of the world will have their turn in time. But for now it’s
just you. At least tell me what the hell those things are made of.
Then we can talk about giving it to other scientists.”
She resumed reading her tablet. The conversation was over.
And she’d ended it by laying down what my students would call
a “sick burn.” Despite my best efforts, I still had no idea what
the heck Astrophage was made of.
They were opaque to every wavelength of light I threw at
them. Visible, infrared, ultraviolet, x-ray, microwaves…I even
put a few Astrophage in a radiation-containment vessel and
exposed it to the gamma rays emitted by Cesium-137 (this lab
has everything). I called it the “Bruce Banner Test.” Felt good
about that name. Anyway, even gamma couldn’t penetrate the
little bastards. Which is like shooting a .50-caliber round at a
sheet of paper and having it bounce off. It just doesn’t make any
sense.
I sulked back to the microscope. The little dots hung out on
the slide where they’d been for hours. This was my control set.
The ones I hadn’t battered with various light sources. “Maybe
I’m overthinking this…” I muttered.
I poked around the lab supplies until I found what I needed:
nanosyringes. They were rare and expensive, but the lab had
them. Basically, they were teeny, tiny needles. Small enough and
sharp enough to be used for poking microorganisms. You could
pull mitochondria out of a living cell with one of those babies.
Back to the microscope. “Okay, you little reprobates. You’re
radiation-proof, I’ll grant you that. But how about I stab you in
the face?”
Normally a nanosyringe would be controlled by finely tuned
equipment. But I just wanted some stabby time and didn’t care
about the tool’s integrity. I grabbed the collet (where it would
normally mount to the control machinery) and brought the
needle into view in the microscope. They’re called nanosyringes,
but they’re actually about 50 nanometers wide. Still, the needle
was tiny compared to the hulking 10-micron Astrophage—only
about one two-thousandth the width.
I poked an Astrophage with the needle and what happened
next was nothing I could have expected.
First off, the needle penetrated. No doubt on that front. For
all its resistance to light and heat, apparently, Astrophage was no
better at dealing with sharp things than any other cell.
The instant I poked a hole in it, the whole cell became
translucent. No longer a featureless black dot, but a cell with
organelles and everything else a microbiologist like me wants to
see. Just like that. It was like flicking a switch.
And then it died. The ruptured cell wall simply gave up the
ghost and completely unraveled. The Astrophage went from
being a cohesive roundish object to a slowly widening puddle
with no outer boundary. I grabbed a normal needle from a
nearby shelf and sucked up the goop.
“Yes!” I said. “I killed one!”
“Good for you,” Stratt said without looking up from her
tablet. “First human to kill an alien. Just like Arnold
Schwarzenegger in Predator.”
“Okay, I know you’re trying to be funny, but that Predator
died by deliberately setting off a bomb. The first human to
actually kill a Predator was Michael Harrigan—played by
Danny Glover—in Predator 2.”
She stared at me through the window for a moment, then
shook her head and rolled her eyes.
“Point is, I can finally find out what Astrophage is made of!”
“Really?” She set the tablet down. “Killing it did the trick?”
“I think so. It’s not black anymore. Light is getting through.
Whatever weird effect was blocking it isn’t anymore.”
“How did you do it? What killed it?”
“I penetrated the outer cell membrane with a nanosyringe.”
“You poked it with a stick?”
“No!” I said. “Well. Yes. But it was a scientific poke with a
very scientific stick.”
“It took you two days to think of poking it with a stick.”
“You…be quiet.”
I took the needle to the spectroscope and ejected the
Astrophage goop onto the platform. Then I sealed the chamber
and fired up the analysis. I bounced from one foot to the other
like a little kid while I waited for the results.
Stratt craned her neck to watch me. “So what’s this you’re
doing now?”
“It’s the atomic-emission spectroscope,” I said. “I told you
about it earlier—it sends x-rays into a sample to excite the
atoms, then watches the wavelengths that come back. Didn’t
work at all when I tried it on the live Astrophage, but now that
the magic light-stopping properties are gone, things should work
like normal.”
The machine beeped.
“All right! Here we go! Time to find out what chemicals are
in a life-form that doesn’t use water!” I read the LCD screen. It
showed all the peaks and the elements they represented. I stared
at the screen silently.
“Well?” Stratt said. “Well?!”
“Um. There’s carbon and nitrogen…but the vast majority of
the sample is hydrogen and oxygen.” I sighed and plopped down
in the chair next to the machine. “The ratio of hydrogen to
oxygen is two to one.”
“What’s wrong?” she asked. “What does that mean?”
“It’s water. Astrophage is mostly water.”
Her mouth fell open. “How? How can something that exists
on the surface of the sun have water?”
I shrugged. “Probably because it maintains its internal
temperature at 96.415 degrees Celsius no matter what’s going
on outside.”
“What does this all mean?” she asked.
I put my head in my hands. “It means every scientific paper I
ever wrote is wrong.”
—
Well. That’s a kick in the pants.
But I wasn’t happy in that lab anyway. And they must have
brought in smarter people than me, because here I am: at
another star in a ship powered by Astrophage.
So why am I the one out here? All I did was prove that my
lifelong belief was wrong.
I guess I’ll remember that part later. For now, I want to know
what star that is. And why we built a ship to bring people here.
All important things, to be sure. But right now, there’s a
whole area of the ship that I haven’t explored yet.
Storage.
Maybe I can find something other than a makeshift toga to
wear.
I climb down the ladder to the lab, and then farther downward
into the dormitory.
My friends are still there. Still dead. I try not to look at them.
I scan the floor for any hint of an access panel. Nothing. So I
get down on my hands and knees and crawl around. Finally, I
spot it—a very thin seam marking a square directly under my
male crewmate’s bunk. I can’t even wedge my fingernail into the
seam it’s so thin.
There were all manner of tools in the lab. I’m sure there’s a
flathead screwdriver I could use to pry this open. Or…
“Hey computer! Open this access panel.”
“Specify aperture to open.”
I point to the panel. “This. This thing. Open it.”
“Specify aperture to open.”
“Uh…open aperture to supply room.”
“Unsealing supply room,” says the computer.
There’s a click and the panel raises a couple of inches. A
rubber gasket around the seam gets torn apart in the process. I
couldn’t see it when the panel was closed, things were that tight.
I’m glad I didn’t try to pry it open. It would have been a pain in
the butt.
I pull the remnants of the seal off the panel and the panel
becomes loose in the opening. I jiggle it a bit before figuring out
I have to rotate it. Once I rotate it 90 degrees it detaches and I
set it aside. I poke my head into the room below and see a
bunch of soft-sided white cubes. I guess that makes sense.
Packing stuff in soft containers lets you cram more things into
the room.
Just as the diagram in the control room said, the storage area
is about a meter high. And completely full of those soft
containers. I would have to remove a bunch just to get in there
—if I wanted to get in there. I guess I’ll have to eventually. It
looks a bit claustrophobic, to be honest. Like the crawlspace
under a house.
I grab the nearest package and pull it up through the opening.
The package is held together by Velcro straps. I pull them
apart and the container unfolds like a Chinese takeout box.
Inside are a bunch of uniforms.
Jackpot! Though not really a coincidence. Whoever packed
this probably did it with careful planning. And they knew the
crew would want uniforms as soon as they woke up. So they’re
in the first bag. There are at least a dozen uniforms in the
package. They’re each in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. I open one
at random.
It’s a light-blue, one-piece jumpsuit. Astronaut clothes. The
fabric is thin but feels comfortable. On the left shoulder is the
Hail Mary mission patch. Same design I saw in the control
room. Beneath that is the Chinese flag. The right shoulder has a
white patch with a blue chevron triangle surrounded by a wreath
design and the letters “CNSA.” I recognize it immediately, nerd
that I am. It’s the Chinese National Space Agency logo.
There’s a name tag over the left breast pocket. It reads 姚—
the same character I saw in the Hail Mary mission crest. It’s
pronounced Yáo.
How do I know—? Of course I know. Commander Yáo. He
was our leader. I can see his face now. Young and striking, eyes
full of determination. He understood the severity of the mission
and the weight on his shoulders. He was ready for the task. He
was stern but reasonable. And you knew—you just knew—he
would give up his life in a second for the mission or his crew.
I pull out another uniform. Much smaller than the
commander’s. The mission patch is the same, but there’s a
Russian flag beneath it. And the right shoulder has a tilted red
chevron surrounded by a ring. It’s the symbol of Roscosmos—
the Russian space agency. The name patch reads ИЛЮХИНА,
another name from the crest. This was Ilyukhina’s uniform.
Olesya Ilyukhina. She was hilarious. She could have you
laughing your butt off within thirty seconds of meeting you. She
just had one of those infectious and jovial personalities. As
serious as Yáo was, Ilyukhina was casual. They butted heads
about it from time to time, but even Yáo couldn’t resist her
charms. I remember when he finally broke down and laughed at
one of her jokes. You can’t be a hundred percent serious
forever.
I stand up and look to the bodies. No longer a stern
commander; no longer a cheerful friend. Just two empty husks
that once held souls but now barely looked human. They deserve
more than this. They deserve a burial.
The container holds multiple outfits for each crewmember. I
eventually find the ones for me. They are exactly as I assumed
they would be. Hail Mary mission patch with a U.S. flag
underneath, a NASA logo on the right shoulder, and a name tag
that says .
I put on my jumpsuit. After more digging in the storage area I
find footwear. They’re not shoes, really. Just thick socks with
rubber soles—booties with some grip. I guess that’s all we’d
need for the mission. I put them on as well.
Then I go about the grim task of dressing my departed
comrades. The jumpsuits don’t remotely look the right size on
their thin, desiccated bodies. I even put the booties on. Why
not? This is our uniform. And a traveler deserves to be buried in
uniform.
I start with Ilyukhina. She weighs almost nothing. I carry her
over my shoulder as I climb the ladders all the way to the
control room. Once there, I set her on the floor and open the
airlock. The spacesuit inside is bulky and in the way. I move it,
piece by piece, into the control room and set it on the pilot’s
chair. Then I put Olesya into the airlock.
The airlock controls are self-explanatory. The air pressure
inside the airlock and even the outer door are controllable by the
panel in the control room. There’s even a Jettison button. I close
the door and activate the jettison process.
It starts with a buzzing alarm, blinking lights inside the
airlock, and a verbal countdown. There are three different
blinking Abort switches inside the airlock. Anyone who finds
themselves in there during a jettison can easily cancel it.
Once the countdown finishes, the airlock decompresses to 10
percent of an atmosphere (according to the readouts). Then it
releases the outer door. With a whoosh, Olesya is gone. And,
with the constantly accelerating ship, the body simply falls away.
“Olesya Ilyukhina,” I say. I don’t remember her religion or if
she even had one. I don’t know what she would have wanted
said. But at least I will remember her name. “I commend your
body to the stars.” It seems appropriate. Maybe corny, but it
makes me feel better.
Next I carry Commander Yáo to the airlock. I set him inside,
seal it, and jettison his remains in the same way.
“Yáo Li-Jie,” I say. I don’t know how I remembered his given
name. It just came to me in the moment. “I commend your
body to the stars.”
The airlock cycles and I am alone. I was alone all along, but
now I am truly alone. The sole living human within several
light-years, at least.
What do I do now?
—
“Welcome back, Mr. Grace!” said Theresa.
The kids all sat in their desks, primed for science class.
“Thanks, Theresa,” I said.
Michael piped in. “The substitute teacher was booooring.”
“Well, I’m not,” I said. I picked up four plastic bins from the
corner. “Today we’re going to look at rocks! Okay, maybe that
is a little boring.”
A chuckle from the kids.
“You’re going to divide into four teams and each team will
get a bin. You have to separate the rocks into igneous,
sedimentary, and metamorphic. First team to finish—and get
every rock correctly categorized—gets beanbags.”
“Can we pick our own teams?” Trang asked excitedly.
“No. That just leads to a bunch of drama. Because children
are animals. Horrible, horrible animals.”
Everyone laughed.
“Teams will be alphabetical. So the first team is—”
Abby raised her hand. “Mr. Grace, can I ask a question?”
“Sure.”
“What’s happening to the sun?”
The whole class suddenly grew much more attentive.
“My dad says it’s not a big deal,” Michael said.
“My dad says it’s a government conspiracy,” said Tamora.
“Okay…” I set the bins down and sat on the edge of my desk.
“So…basically, you know how there’s algae in the ocean, right?
Well, there’s sort of a space algae growing in the sun.”
“Astrophage?” said Harrison.
I almost slipped off the desk. “Wh-Where did you hear that
word?”
“That’s what they’re calling it now,” said Harrison. “The
president called it that in a speech last night.”
I’d been so isolated in that lab I didn’t even know the
president had given a speech. And holy cow. I invented that
word for Stratt the day before. In that time it got from her to the
president to the media.
Wow.
“Okay, yes. Astrophage. And it’s growing on the sun. Or near
it. People aren’t sure.”
“So what’s the problem?” Michael asked. “Algae in the ocean
doesn’t hurt us. Why would algae on the sun?”
I pointed to him. “Good question. Thing is, Astrophage is
starting to absorb a lot of the sun’s energy. Well, not a lot. Just a
tiny percentage. But that means Earth gets a tiny bit less
sunlight. And that can cause real problems.”
“So it’ll be a little colder? Like a degree or two?” Abby asked.
“What’s the big deal?”
“You guys know about climate change, right? How our CO2
emissions have caused a lot of problems in the environment?”
“My dad says that’s not real,” said Tamora.
“Well, it is,” I said. “Anyway. All the environmental problems
we have from climate change? They happened because the
world’s average temperature went up one and a half degrees.
That’s it. Just one and a half degrees.”
“How much will this Astrophage stuff change Earth’s
temperature?” asked Luther.
I stood and paced slowly in front of the class. “We don’t
know. But if it breeds like algae does, at about that same speed,
climatologists are saying Earth’s temperature could drop ten to
fifteen degrees.”
“What’ll happen?” Luther asked.
“It’ll be bad. Very bad. A lot of animals—entire species—will
die out because their habitats are too cold. The ocean water will
cool down, too, and it might cause an entire food-chain collapse.
So even things that could survive the lower temperature will
starve to death because the things they eat all die off.”
The kids stared at me, awestruck. Why had their parents not
explained this to them? Probably because they didn’t understand
it themselves.
Besides, if I had a nickel for every time I wanted to smack a
kid’s parents for not teaching them even the most basic things…
well…I’d have enough nickels to put in a sock and smack those
parents with it.
“Animals are going to die too?!” Abby asked, horrified.
Abby rode horses competitively and spent most of her time at
her grandfather’s dairy farm. Human suffering is often an
abstract concept to kids. But animal suffering is something else
entirely.
“Yes, I’m sorry, but a lot of livestock will die. And it’s worse
than that. On land, crops will fail. The food we eat will become
scarce. When that happens, the social order often breaks down
and—” I stopped myself there. These were kids. Why was I
going this far?
“How—” Abby began. I’d never seen her at a loss for words.
“How long before this happens?”
“Climatologists think it’ll happen within the next thirty
years,” I said.
Just like that, all the kids relaxed.
“Thirty years?” Trang laughed. “That’s forever!”
“It’s not that long…” I said. But to a bunch of twelve- and
thirteen-year-olds, thirty years may as well be a million.
“Can I be on Tracy’s team for the rock-sorting assignment?”
asked Michael.
Thirty years. I looked out at their little faces. In thirty years
they’d all be in their early forties. They would bear the brunt of
it all. And it wouldn’t be easy. These kids were going to grow up
in an idyllic world and be thrown into an apocalyptic nightmare.
They were the generation that would experience the Sixth
Extinction Event.
I felt a cramp in the pit of my stomach. I was looking out at a
room full of children. Happy children. And there was a good
chance some of them would literally die of starvation.
“I…” I stammered. “I have to go do a thing. Forget the rock
assignment.”
“What?” asked Luther.
“Do…study hall. This is study hall for the rest of the hour.
Just do homework from other classes. Stay in your seats and
work quietly until the bell rings.”
I left the room without another word. I almost collapsed in
the hall from the shakes. I went to a nearby drinking fountain
and splashed water on my face. Then I took a deep breath, got
some self-control back, and jogged to the parking lot.
I drove fast. Way too fast. I ran red lights. I cut people off. I
never do any of that, but that day was different. That day was…I
don’t even know.
I screeched into the lab parking lot and left my car parked at
an odd angle.
Two U.S. Army soldiers were at the doors to the complex.
Just as they had been the previous two days while I’d been
working there. I stormed past them.
“Should we have stopped him?” I heard one ask the other. I
didn’t care what the response was.
I stomped into the observation room. Stratt was there, of
course, reading her tablet. She looked up and I caught a glimpse
of genuine surprise on her face.
“Dr. Grace? What are you doing here?”
Past her, through the windows, I spotted four people in
containment suits working in the lab.
“Who are they?” I said, pointing at the window. “And what
are they doing in my lab?”
“Can’t say I like your tone—” she said.
“I don’t care.”
“And it’s not your lab. It’s my lab. Those technicians are
collecting the Astrophage.”
“What are you going to do with it?”
She held her tablet under her arm. “Your dream is coming
true. I’m dividing up the Astrophage and sending it to thirty
different labs around the world. Everything from CERN to a
CIA bioweapons facility.”
“The CIA has a biowea—?” I began. “Never mind. I want to
do more work on this.”
She shook her head. “You’ve done your part. We thought it
was anhydrous life. Turns out it wasn’t. You proved that. And
since no alien exploded out of your chest, we can consider the
guinea-pig phase over too. So you’re done.”
“No, I’m not done. There’s a lot more to learn.”
“Of course there is,” she said. “And I have thirty labs all
eagerly waiting to get started on it.”
I stepped forward. “Leave some Astrophage here. Let me
work it some more.”
She stepped forward as well. “No.”
“Why not?!”
“According to your notes, there were one hundred and
seventy-four living Astrophage cells in the sample. And you
killed one yesterday, so we’re down to a hundred and seventythree.”
She pointed to her tablet. “Each of these labs—huge, national
labs—will get five or six cells each. That’s it. We’re down to that
level of scarcity. Those cells are the one hundred and seventythree most important things on Earth right now. Our analysis of
them will determine if humanity survives.”
She paused and spoke a little more softly. “I get it. You spent
your whole life trying to prove that life doesn’t require water.
Then, unbelievably, you get some actual extraterrestrial life and
it turns out to need water. That’s rough. Shake it off and get
back to your life. I’ve got it from here.”
“I’m still a microbiologist who spent his career working up
theoretical models for alien life. I’m a useful resource with a
skill set almost no one else has.”
“Dr. Grace, I don’t have the luxury of leaving samples here
just to stroke your bruised ego.”
“Ego?! This isn’t about my ego! It’s about my children!”
“You don’t have children.”
“Yes, I do! Dozens of them. They come to my class every
day. And they’re all going to end up in a Mad Max nightmare
world if we don’t solve this problem. Yeah, I was wrong about
the water. I don’t care about that. I care about those kids. So
give me some gosh-darned Astrophage!”
She stepped back and pursed her lips. She looked to the side,
thinking it over. Then she turned back to me. “Three. You can
have three Astrophage.”
I unclenched my muscles. “Okay.” I breathed a little. I didn’t
realize how tense I’d been. “Okay. Three. I can work with that.”
She typed on her tablet. “I’ll keep this lab open. It’s all yours.
Come back in a few hours and my guys will be gone.”
I was already halfway into a containment suit. “I’m getting
back to work now. Tell your guys to stay out of my way.”
She glared at me but didn’t say anything further.
—
I have to do this for my kids.
I mean…they’re not my kids. But they’re my kids.
I look at the screens arrayed before me. I need to think about
this.
My memory is spotty. Seems reliable enough, but incomplete.
Instead of waiting for an epiphany where I remember
everything, what can I work out right now?
Earth is in trouble. The sun is infected with Astrophage. I’m
in a spaceship in another solar system. This ship wasn’t easy to
build and it had an international crew. We’re talking about an
interstellar mission—something that should be impossible with
our technology. Okay, so humanity put a lot of time and effort
into this mission, and Astrophage was the missing link that
enabled it.
There’s only one explanation: There’s a solution to the
Astrophage problem here. Or a potential solution. Something
promising enough to dedicate a huge amount of resources.
I scour the screens for more info. Mostly they seem to be the
kinds of things you’d expect on a spaceship. Life support,
navigation, that sort of thing. One screen is labeled “Beetles.”
The next screen over says—
Wait, beetles?
Okay, I don’t know if it has anything to do with anything, but
I need to find out if there are a bunch of beetles on this ship.
That’s the sort of thing a guy needs to know.
The screen is broken into four quadrants, each one showing
nearly the same thing. A little schematic and a bunch of text
information. The schematics each show a bulbous, oblong shape
with a pointed head and a trapezoid on the back. If you tilt your
head just right and squint, I suppose it kind of looks like a
beetle. Each beetle also has a name up top: “John,” “Paul,”
“George,” and “Ringo.”
Yeah, I get it. I’m not laughing, but I get it.
I arbitrarily pick one beetle, John, and give it a good look.
John is no insect. I’m pretty sure he’s a spaceship. The
trapezoid in the rear is labeled “Spin Drive,” and the entire
bulbous part is labeled “Fuel.” The little head has a “Computer”
label and a “Radio” label.
I look a little closer. The Fuel info box says :
120—: 96.415°. The Computer box says 
: 3  . 5   . And the
Radio info just says : 100%.
It’s an unmanned probe. Something small, I guess. The entire
mass of the fuel is just 120 kilograms. That’s not a lot. But a
little Astrophage goes a long way. There aren’t any scientific
instruments labeled. What’s the point of an unmanned ship with
nothing on board?
Wait…what if the 5 terabytes of storage is the point of the
ship?
A realization dawns on me.
“Oh. Shucks,” I say.
I’m out in space. I’m in another star system. I don’t know how
much Astrophage it took to get here, but it was probably a lot.
Sending a ship to another star probably took an absurd amount
of fuel. Sending that ship to another star and bringing it back
would take ten times as much fuel.
I check the Astrophage panel to refresh my memory.
REMAINING: 20,862 KG
CONSUMPTION RATE: 6.043 G/S
The consumption rate was 6.045 grams per second before. So
it’s gone down a little bit. And the fuel amount went down too.
Basically, as the fuel gets consumed, the total mass of the ship
goes down, so it needs less fuel per second to maintain the
constant acceleration. Okay, that all makes sense.
I have no idea what the Hail Mary’s mass is, but to be able to
shove it along at 1.5 g’s of acceleration on a few grams of fuel
per second…Astrophage is amazing stuff.
Anyway, I don’t know exactly how the consumption rate will
change over time (I mean, I could work it out, but it’s
complicated). So for now I’ll just approximate it to 6 grams per
second. How long will that fuel last?
It’s nice to have a jumpsuit on. It’s got pockets for all sorts of
knickknacks. I still haven’t found a calculator, so I do the math
with a pen and paper. Grand total, I’ll run out of fuel in about
forty days.
I don’t know what star that is, but it’s not the sun. And there’s
just no way to get from any other star to Earth with just forty
days of accelerating at 1.5 g’s. It probably took years to get here
from Earth—which might be why I was in a coma. Interesting.
Anyway, all this can only mean one thing: The Hail Mary
isn’t going home. This is a one-way ticket. And I’m pretty sure
these beetles are how I’m supposed to send information back to
Earth.
There’s no way I have a radio transmitter powerful enough to
broadcast several light-years. I don’t know if that would even be
possible to build. So instead, I have these little “beetle” ships
with 5 terabytes of information each. They’ll fly back to Earth
and broadcast their data. There’s four of them for redundancy.
I’m probably supposed to put copies of my findings in each one
and send them all home. If at least one survives the journey,
Earth is saved.
I’m on a suicide mission. John, Paul, George, and Ringo get
to go home, but my long and winding road ends here. I must
have known all this when I volunteered. But to my amnesiariddled brain this is new information. I’m going to die out here.
And I’m going to die alone.</p>
