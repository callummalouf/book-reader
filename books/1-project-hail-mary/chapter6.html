  <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
  <p>Okay, if I’m going to die, it’s going to have meaning. I’m
going to figure out what can be done to stop Astrophage. And
then I’ll send my answers off to Earth. And then…I’ll die. There
are lots of avenues for painless suicide here—from overdosing
on meds to reducing the oxygen until I fall asleep and die.
Cheerful thought.
I eat a delicious tube of “Day 4—Meal 2.” I think it’s beefflavored. The food is getting chunkier now. There are actually
some solids in there. I think I’m chewing on a little cube of
carrot. It’s nice to feel some texture in the food for a change.
“More water!” I say.
The NannyBot (as I’ve come to call it) quickly takes my
plastic cup away and replaces it with a full one. It’s funny. Three
days ago those ceiling-mounted arms were a mechanical
monster that haunted me. Now they’re just…there. Part of life.
I’ve found the dormitory to be a good place for thinking. Now
that the dead bodies are gone, anyway. The lab doesn’t have
anywhere comfortable to relax. The control room has a nice
chair, but it’s cramped and has blinking lights everywhere. But
the dormitory has my nice, comfortable bed I can lie back on
while I think about what to do next. Plus, the bedroom is where
all the food comes from.
I remembered a lot over the past couple of days. Looks like
Project Hail Mary was a success, because here I am, in another
star system. Tau Ceti, I assume. It makes sense that I’d mistake
it for the sun. Tau Ceti is very similar to the sun as stars go.
Same spectral type, color, and so on.
And I know why I’m here! Not just in vague terms like “Oh
hey, the world’s ending. Make that not happen.” But very
specifically: Find out why Tau Ceti wasn’t affected by
Astrophage.
Easy to say. Hard to do. Hopefully I remember more details
later.
A million questions run through my mind. Some of the most
important are:
1. How do I scour an entire solar system for information
about Astrophage?
2. What am I supposed to do? Throw some of my
Astrophage fuel at Tau Ceti to see what happens?
3. How do I steer this ship anyway?
4. If I do find useful information, how do I tell Earth about
it? I think that’s what the beetles are for, but how do I
upload data to them? How do I aim them? How do I
launch them?
5. Why would I, of all people, be part of this mission? Yes, I
worked out a bunch of stuff about Astrophage, but so
what? I’m a lab coat, not an astronaut. It’s not like they
sent Wernher von Braun into space. Surely there were
more qualified people.
I decide to start small. First I have to work out what this ship
can do and how to control it. They put the crew in comas. They
must have known it might mess with our minds. There has to be
an instruction manual somewhere.
“Flight manual,” I say out loud.
“Ship information can be found in the control room,” says the
NannyBot.
“Where?”
“Ship information can be found in the control room.”
“No. Where in the control room can ship information be
found?”
“Ship information can be found in the control room.”
“You kind of suck,” I say.
I make my way up to the control room and take a good long
look at every screen. I spend an hour in there cataloging what
each area seems to say, and make guesses as to what the
functions are. What I’m really looking for is something like
“Information” or “Here to save humanity? Press this button to
learn more!”
No such luck. After hours of poking at screens, I’ve found
nothing. I guess they figured if the crew are so brain-mushy that
they don’t remember how to use the ship, they’re probably not
useful as scientists anyway.
I did find out that any screen can show any instrument panel.
They’re pretty much interchangeable. Just tap the upper-left
corner and a menu shows up. Pick whatever panel you like.
That’s nice. You can customize what you’re looking at. And
the screen directly in front of the pilot’s seat is the largest.
I decide on a more tactile approach: I’m gonna start pushing
buttons!
Hopefully there’s no “Blow Up the Ship” button. I think Stratt
would have kept that from happening.
Stratt. I wonder what she’s doing right now. Probably in a
control room somewhere with the pope making her a cup of
coffee. She was (is?) a really domineering person. But gosh darn
it, I’m glad she was in charge of making this ship happen. Now
that I’m aboard it and all. Her attention to detail and insistence
on perfection are nice to have all around me.
Anyway, I bring up the “Scientific Instrumentation” panel on
the main screen. It’s the same panel I spent a lot of quality time
with earlier—the one that currently shows an image of Tau Ceti.
It has the word “Helioscope” in the upper-left corner. I hadn’t
noticed that before. The left side of the screen has a bunch of
icons. Other equipment, I assume. I press one at random.
Tau Ceti disappears. The top-left corner changes to read
“External Collection Unit.” The screen shows a diagram of a
featureless rectangle. There are some controls here and there to
change the angle and to “open bow side” and “open stern side.”
Okay. Noted. Not sure what to do with that information. I press
another icon at random.
This time it changes to “Petrovascope.” Beyond that, there’s
just a black screen with an error message:
       .
“Hmph,” I say.
Okay, what’s a Petrovascope? Best guess: a telescope and/or
camera that looks specifically for the IR light that Astrophage
emit. It looks for the Petrova line via the Petrova wavelength so
it’s a Petrovascope and we really need to stop putting “Petrova”
in front of everything.
Why can’t I use it when the spin drive is active?
I don’t how a spin drive works, or why it’s called a spin drive,
but I do know I have one in the back of the ship and it’s
consuming Astrophage as fuel. So it’s my engine. It probably
activates enriched Astrophage to use them as thrust.
Ah…that would mean there’s a ridiculous amount of IR light
coming out the back of the ship right now. Like…enough to
vaporize a battleship or something. I’d have to do the math to
know for sure but—I can’t help it, I want to do the math right
now.
The engines consume 6 grams of Astrophage per second.
Astrophage stores energy as mass. So basically, the spin drive
converts 6 grams of mass into pure energy every second and
spits it out the back. Well, it’s the Astrophage doing the work,
but whatever.
I bring up the “Utility” panel on a smaller screen to my right.
It has a bunch of familiar applications, all ready to go. One of
them is a calculator. I use it to calculate the mass-conversion
energy of that 6 grams…good Lord. It’s 540 trillion Joules. And
the ship is emitting that much energy every second. So it’s 540
trillion watts. I can’t even fathom that amount of energy. It’s
considerably more than the surface of the sun. Literally. Like…
you would get hit by less energy if you were on the surface of
the sun than if you were standing behind the Hail Mary at full
thrust.
I’m decelerating right now. Have to be. The plan is to come to
rest in the Tau Ceti system. So I’m probably pointed away from
the star and slowing down—having spent a really long time at
near light speed during the trip.
Okay, so all that light energy will hit dust particles, ions, and
anything else between me at Tau Ceti as I plug along. Those
poor little particles will be brutally vaporized. And that’ll scatter
some IR light back at the ship. Not much compared to the
engine output, but it would be blinding to the Petrovascope,
which is finely tuned to look for trace amounts of that exact
frequency.
So no using the Petrovascope with the engine on.
But man. I would love to know if Tau Ceti has a Petrova line.
Theoretically, any star infected with Astrophage should have
one, right? The little blighters need carbon dioxide to breed.
Can’t get that from the star (unless you go way into the core,
and I don’t know if even Astrophage could survive those
temperatures).
If I see a Petrova line, it means that Tau Ceti has an active
Astrophage population that, for some reason, hasn’t grown out
of control like it has everywhere else. And that line will lead to
a planet that has carbon dioxide. Maybe there’s some other
chemical in that atmosphere that impedes the Astrophage?
Maybe the planet has a weird magnetic field that messes with
their ability to navigate? Maybe the planet has a bunch of
moons that the Astrophage physically collides with?
Maybe Tau Ceti just doesn’t have any planets with carbon
dioxide in their atmospheres. That would suck. It would mean
this whole trip was for nothing and Earth is doomed.
I could speculate all day. Without data, it’s just pure
guesswork. And without the Petrovascope, I don’t have data. At
least, not the data I want.
I turn my attention to the Navigation screen. Should I mess
with it? I mean—I don’t know how to fly this ship. The ship
does, but I don’t. If I push the wrong button, I’ll be dead in
space.
Actually, it would be worse than that. I’d be hurtling toward
Tau Ceti at—I check the info on-screen—7,595 kilometers per
second. Wow! A couple days ago, that was over 11,000. That’s
what constantly accelerating at 1.5  g’s will do for you. Or
“decelerating,” I guess. From a physics standpoint it’s all the
same. Point is, I’m slowing down with respect to the star.
There’s a button on-screen that just says “Course.” That
seems reasonable to tap, right? Famous last words. Really I
should just wait until the computer feels like the trip is done.
But I can’t help myself.
I tap the button. The screen changes to show the Tau Ceti
solar system. Tau Ceti itself sits at the center, denoted with the
Greek letter tau.
Ohhhh…that’s what the lowercase t is on the Hail Mary crest.
It’s a tau, for “Tau Ceti.” Okay.
Anyway, four planetary orbits are shown as thin white ellipses
around the star. The locations of the planets themselves are
shown as circles with error bars. We don’t have super-accurate
information on exoplanets. If I could figure out how to get the
science instruments working, I could probably get much better
info on those planet locations. I’m twelve light-years closer to
them than astronomers on Earth.
A yellow line runs almost directly into the system from offscreen. It bends toward the star somewhere between the third
and fourth planets and into a circle. There’s a yellow triangle on
the line, way far away from the four planets. Pretty sure that’s
me. And the yellow line is my course. Above the map is the
text:
TIME TO ENGINE CUTOFF: 0005:20:39:06
The final digit decrements once per second. Okay, I learned a
couple of things here. First off, I have about five days left
(closer to six) before the engine cuts off. Second off, the readout
has four digits for days. That means this journey took at least
one thousand days. Over three years. Well, it takes light twelve
years to make this trip, so it should take me a long time too.
Oh, right. Relativity.
I have no idea how much time it took. Or, rather, I have no
idea how much time I experienced. When you get going near
the speed of light, you experience time dilation. More time will
have gone by on Earth than I have experienced since I left
Earth.
Relativity is weird.
Time is of the essence here. And unfortunately, while I slept,
Earth experienced at least thirteen years. And even if I find a
solution to the Astrophage problem right now, it would take at
least thirteen years for that information to get back to Earth. So
that means there’ll be an absolute minimum of twenty-six years
of Astrophage misery on Earth. I can only hope they are coming
up with ways to deal with it. Or at least ameliorate the damage. I
mean, they wouldn’t have sent the Hail Mary out at all if they
didn’t think they could survive at least twenty-six years, right?
In any event, the trip took at least three years (from my point
of view). Is that why we were put in comas? Was there a
problem with us just being awake for the duration?
I only notice the tears when the first of them drops off my
face. That decision to put us in comas killed two close friends of
mine. They’re gone. I don’t remember a single moment with
either of them, but the feeling of loss is overwhelming. I’ll be
joining them soon. There’s no way home. I’ll die out here too.
But unlike them, I’ll die alone.
I wipe my eyes and try to think of other things. My whole
species is at stake here.
Judging by the path on the map, the ship will automatically
put me in a stable orbit around Tau Ceti, between the third and
fourth planets. If I had to guess, I would say that’s probably 1
AU. The distance that Earth is from the sun. A nice, safe
distance from the star. A slow orbit that takes about a year to
complete. Probably longer, because Tau Ceti is smaller than the
sun, so it probably has less mass. Less mass means less gravity
and a slower orbital period at a given distance.
Okay, I have five days to kill until engine cutoff. Rather than
mess around with stuff, I’ll just wait it out. Once the engines are
off, I’ll fire up the Petrovascope and see what’s out there. Until
then, I’ll try to learn as much about the ship as I can.
I’ll do just about anything right now to keep from thinking
about Yáo and Ilyukhina.
—
Technically the carrier was named the People’s Liberation Army
Navy Gansu. Why their navy has “Army” in its name I’ll never
know. Regardless, people stopped calling it that and started
calling it Stratt’s Vat. Despite objections from the sailors aboard,
the name stuck. We wandered around the South China Sea,
never getting too close to land.
I’d spent a blissful week doing nothing but science.
No meetings. No distractions. Just experimentation and
engineering. I’d forgotten how much fun it was to get immersed
in a task.
My first breeder prototype had demonstrated another
successful run. It wasn’t much to look at—mostly a 30-foot-long
metal pipe with a bunch of ugly control equipment welded on
here and there. But it did the trick. It could only generate a few
micrograms of Astrophage per hour, but the concept was solid.
I had a staff of twelve people—engineers from all over the
world. A couple of Mongolian brothers were my best engineers.
When I got a call from Stratt to meet her in the conference
room, I left them in charge.
I found her alone in the meeting room. The table was strewn
with papers and charts, like always. Graphs and diagrams
adorned all the walls—some new, some old.
Stratt sat at one end of the long table, with a bottle of Dutch
gin and a lowball glass. I’d never seen her drink before.
“You wanted to see me?” I said.
She looked up. Her eyes had bags. She hadn’t slept. “Yeah.
Have a seat.”
I sat in the chair next to her. “You look terrible. What’s going
on?”
“I have to make a decision. And it’s not easy.”
“How can I help?”
She offered me the gin. I shook my head. She topped off her
own glass. “The Hail Mary is going to have a very small crew
compartment—about 125 cubic meters.”
I cocked my head. “That’s actually kind of big as spaceships
go, right?”
She wiggled her hand back and forth. “Big for a capsule like
Soyuz or Orion. But tiny for a space station. It’s about one-tenth
as big as the International Space Station’s crew compartment.”
“Okay,” I said. “What’s the problem?”
“The problem”—she picked up a manila folder and dropped
it in front of me—“is that the crew will kill each other.”
“Huh?” I opened the folder. Inside were lots of typewritten
pages. Actually, they were scans of typed pages. Some were in
English, some in Russian. “What is all this?”
“During the Space Race, the Soviets briefly set their sights on
Mars. They figured if they put people on Mars, the U.S. moon
landing would be trivial in comparison.”
I closed the folder. The Cyrillic writing was nonsense to me.
But my guess was Stratt could read it. She always seemed to
know whatever language was being used.
She rested her chin on her hands. “Getting to Mars with
1970s technology would mean using a Hohmann transfer
trajectory, which means the crew would have to spend just over
eight months aboard a ship. So the Soviets tested out what
happens when you put people together in a cramped, isolated
environment for several months.”
“And?”
“After seventy-one days, the men inside were getting in
fistfights every day. They stopped the experiment on day ninetyfour because one of the subjects tried to stab another one to
death with broken glass.”
“How big will the crew be for the mission?”
“The current plan is three,” she said.
“Okay,” I said. “So you’re worried what happens when we
send three astronauts on a four-year trip in a 125-cubic-meter
compartment?”
“It’s not just about them getting along. Each crew member
would spend the whole trip knowing that they’re going to die in
a few years. And that the few rooms on that ship are the only
world they will know for the rest of their short lives. The
psychiatrists I’ve talked to say that crushing depression is likely.
And suicide is a real risk.”
“Yeah, that is some rough psychology,” I said. “But what else
can we do?”
She picked up a stapled sheaf of papers and slid it toward me.
I picked it up and read the title: “A Study of Long-Term
Primate and Human Coma Patients and Detrimental
Aftereffects—Srisuk et al.”
“Okay. What am I looking at here?”
“That’s a study by a failed company in Thailand.” She swirled
the gin in her glass. “Their idea was to put cancer patients into
induced comas for their chemotherapy treatments. The patient
gets the chemo, but doesn’t have to be awake to suffer through
the process. Wake them up when the cancer goes into remission.
Or when it’s no longer treatable and it’s time for hospice. Either
way, they skip a lot of misery.”
“That…sounds like a great idea,” I said.
She nodded. “It would be, if it wasn’t so lethal. Turns out the
human body just isn’t supposed to be in a coma for a long time.
Chemo lasts months, and often needs additional rounds after
that. They tried various means for medically induced comas on
primates, and the primates either died during the coma or came
out of it with mush for brains.”
“So why are we talking about it?”
“Because they did more studies—this time on historical
human coma patient data. They looked at humans who had
come through long comas relatively unscathed and tried to see
what they had in common. They found it.”
Old Russian space-agency documents were a mystery to me,
but scientific papers were my forte for a long time. I flipped
through the paper and skimmed to the findings. “Gene
markers?” I said.
“Yes,” she said. “They found a collection of genes that give a
human ‘coma resistance.’ That’s what they’re calling it. The
sequences are in what scientists used to think was junk DNA.
But apparently it’s something we evolved a long time ago for
some unknown reason and still lurks in some people’s genetic
code.”
“Are they sure these genes cause coma resistance?” I said.
“They correlate, but do they cause it?”
“Yes, they’re sure. The genes are found in lower primates too.
Whatever it is, it goes way back in the evolutionary tree. There’s
speculation it might go all the way back to our aquatic ancestors
that used to hibernate. In any event, they ran tests on primates
with those genes and they survived long comas with no side
effects. Every single one of them.”
“Okay. I see where you’re going with this.” I put the paper
down. “Do DNA tests on all applicants, and use only the people
who have those coma-resistance genes. During the trip, put the
crew in comas. They don’t have to experience four years of
getting on each other’s nerves or introspection about their
deaths.”
She raised her glass to me. “It gets better. Having the crew in
comas makes the food situation much easier. Powdered,
nutritionally balanced slurry pumped right into their stomachs.
No need for a thousand kilograms of diverse meals. Just powder
and a self-contained water-recycling system.”
I smiled. “This seems like a dream come true. Like
suspended animation in sci-fi novels. Why are you drinking and
stressed-out?”
“There are a couple of catches,” she said. “First off, we’d
have to develop a completely automated monitoring and action
system to take care of the coma patients. If it broke down,
everyone would die. There’s more to it than just monitoring
vitals and pushing the right drugs through an IV. It would have
to physically move and clean the patients, deal with bedsores,
diagnose and treat secondary issues like inflammation and
infection around the various IV and probe entry points. Stuff
like that.”
“Okay, but that seems like something the global medical
community could work out for us,” I said. “Use your Stratt
magic to boss them around or something.”
She took another sip. “That’s not the main problem. The main
problem is this: On average, only one in every seven thousand
humans has that genetic sequence.”
I sat back in my chair. “Whoa.”
“Yeah. We wouldn’t be able to send the most qualified
people. We’d be sending the seven-thousandth most qualified
people.”
“Three-thousand-five-hundredth most qualified people on
average,” I said.
She rolled her eyes.
“Still,” I said. “One seven-thousandth of the world’s
population is a million people. Think of it that way. You’d have
a pool of one million people to look through for candidates. All
you need are three.”
“Six,” she said. “We need a primary crew and a backup crew.
Can’t have the mission fail because some guy gets hit by a car
crossing the street the day before launch.”
“Okay, then six.”
“Yeah. Six people of astronaut caliber, who have the scientific
skills necessary to work out what’s going on with Astrophage at
Tau Ceti, and who are willing to go on a suicide mission.”
“Out of a population of a million,” I said. “A million.”
She fell silent and took another sip of gin.
I cleared my throat. “So you either take your chances with
picking the best possible candidates and maybe they kill each
other, or you take your chances on yet-to-be-developed medical
technology to automatically care for a lower tier of talent.”
“More or less. Either way, it’s a terrible risk. It’s the hardest
decision I’ve ever had to make.”
“Good thing you already made up your mind, then,” I said.
She raised an eyebrow. “Huh?”
“Sure,” I said. “You just wanted someone to tell you what you
already know. If you leave the crew awake, there’s nothing you
can do about the psychosis risk. But we’ve got years to perfect
the automated-coma-bed technology.”
She scowled a bit but didn’t speak.
I softened my voice. “Besides. We’re already asking these
people to die. We shouldn’t ask them to suffer emotional
torment for four years too. Science and morality both give the
same answer here, and you know it.”
She nodded, almost imperceptibly. Then, she downed the rest
of her gin. “All right. You can go.” She slid her laptop over and
began typing.
I left without another word. She had her stuff to deal with and
I had mine.
—
The memories are coming back more smoothly now. I still can’t
remember everything, but it’s no longer an epiphany when they
happen. It’s just sort of…“Oh hey, I know that. Always knew it,
really.”
I guess I’m one of those people with coma resistance. That
explains why I’m here instead of any of the far more qualified
candidates that should have been sent.
But Yáo and Ilyukhina probably had those genes, too, and
they didn’t make it. My guess is the medical robot wasn’t
perfect. They must have had some medical situation arise it
couldn’t figure out.
I shake off their memory.
The next several days are an exercise in patience. I learn more
about the ship to distract myself.
I catalog the entire lab. One of the first things I find is a
touchscreen computer in a pull-out drawer in the center table.
It’s actually a fantastic find, because it has a bunch of researchrelated screens. As opposed to the panels in the control room,
which are all about the ship or its instruments.
I see a bunch of math and science apps—most of which are
off-the-shelf that I’m familiar with. But the real boon is the
library!
As far as I can tell, this panel can bring up literally any
scientific textbook ever written, every scientific paper ever
published on any topic, and a whole lot more. There’s one
directory just called “Library of Congress,” and it appears to be
the entire digital catalog of everything that’s ever been
copyrighted in the United States. No books about the Hail
Mary, unfortunately.
And the reference manuals. So many reference manuals. Data
on top of data with data in between. I guess they figured solid-
state hard drives are light, so there was no reason to be stingy
with information. Heck, they may have just burned the data into
ROMs.
They gave me reference material on stuff that can’t possibly
be useful. But hey, it’s nice to know that if I need the average
rectal temperature of a healthy goat, I can find that out! (It’s
103.4°F / 39.7°C.)
Playing with the panel leads to my next discovery: I know
how I’ll report back to Earth with the beetles.
I knew they’d be involved, but now I know specifics. In
addition to the absurd data storage array aboard the ship, the
panel also has four comparatively small external drives
mounted: John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Each one of those
shows 5 terabytes free. It’s not a huge leap to assume that’s the
beetle’s data.
So how do I launch them when the time comes? To find out, I
head to the control room.
I have to dig through a few layers of UI on the Beetles panel
to find the launch command, but I find it. As far as I can tell, it’s
just a button labeled “Launch.” I guess they orient themselves
based on stars and head toward Earth on their own. The Hail
Mary did the same thing to get here, so they know how to do it.
No reason to introduce human error in the course selection.
While I’m here, I poke around the Scientific Instrumentation
screen. The first few subwindows are the helioscope, the
Petrovascope, and a telescope that can see in the visible
spectrum, IR spectrum, and a bunch of other bands.
I play with the visible-light telescope. It’s kind of fun. I can
look at the stars. I mean, there’s nothing else out there. Even
Tau Ceti’s planets would just be little dots from where I am. But
it’s still nice to see the outside from my confined little world.
I also found a dedicated EVA screen. It has more or less what
I would have expected. There are a bunch of controls for the
EVA suit itself, so an operator in the control room can manage
any issue with the suit during an EVA. That way, the person in
the suit doesn’t have to deal with it. Plus, it looks like the ship
has a complicated tethering system on the hull. Basically a
bunch of tracks that the tether hook can run along. They really
figured an EVA would be important. Probably to collect local
Astrophage.
If there is any.
If Tau Ceti has a Petrova line, then there’s Astrophage to be
collected. Getting ahold of some would be step one. Getting that
down to the lab, and seeing if it differs from the Astrophage on
Earth. Maybe it’s a less virulent strain?
The next two days are, basically, me worrying about what
happens next. Oh, I know what happens next—I’m just
worrying about it anyway.
I fidget in the control room and watch the seconds tick away.
“You’re going to be in zero g,” I say. “You are not going to be
falling. You will not be in danger. The acceleration of the ship
will stop. But that’s okay.”
I don’t like roller coasters or water slides. That dropping
sensation scares the pants off me. And in a few seconds I’m
going to feel that exact sensation because the “gravity” I’ve been
experiencing will stop altogether.
The seconds tick off. “Four…three…two…”
“Here we go,” I said.
“One…zero.”
Right on schedule, the engines shut off. The 1.5 g’s I’ve been
feeling all this time vanishes. Gravity is gone.
I panic. No amount of mental preparation would have
worked. I straight-up panic.
I scream and flail around. I force myself to curl into a fetal
position—it’s comforting and keeps me from hitting any
controls or screens.
I shiver and shake as I float around the control room. I should
have strapped myself to the chair, but I didn’t think to. Dummy.
“I’m not falling!” I scream. “I’m not falling! This is just
space! Everything is fine!”
It’s not fine. I feel my stomach in my throat. I’m going to
puke. Puke in zero g is not okay. I don’t have a bag. I severely
underprepared for this. I was stupid to think I could just talk
myself out of a primal fear.
I pull the collar of my jumpsuit open and tilt my head down.
I’m just in the nick of time. I puke out the entirety of “Day 9—
Meal 3” into my shirt. I hold the collar tight to my chest
afterward. It’s disgusting, but contained. Better than letting it
float around the control room and becoming a choking hazard.
“Oh gosh…” I whimper. “Gosh…this is…”
Can I do this? Will I be rendered completely worthless from
this point on? Will humanity die because I can’t handle zero g?
No.
I clench my teeth. I clench my fists. I clench my butt. I clench
every part of me that I know how to clench. It gives me a feeling
of control. I’m doing something by aggressively doing nothing.
After an eternity, the panic begins to ebb away. Human
brains are amazing things. We can get used to just about
anything. I’m making the adjustment.
The slight reduction of fear has a feedback effect. I know I
will get less afraid now. And knowing that makes the fear
subside even faster. Soon, the panic dies down to fear, which
diffuses into general anxiousness.
I look around the control room and nothing seems right.
Nothing changed, but now there’s no down. I still feel sick to my
stomach. I grab my collar in case I need to puke again but it
isn’t necessary. I hold it in.
The feeling of warm vomit squishing between my chest and
jumpsuit is disgusting. I need to change.
I aim myself at the hatchway leading to the lab and kick off
the bulkhead behind me. I float down and into the lab. The
whole room is cluttered with random floating debris. I left
things out on the table when I cataloged them. Now all that stuff
is wandering around freely, wafted along by currents from the
life-support air vents.
“Dummy,” I say to myself. I really should have seen that
coming.
I continue onward to the bedroom. Not surprisingly, it’s also
got junk floating everywhere. I opened most of the bins in the
storage area to see what was inside. Now the bins and their
contents drift to and fro.
“Clean me!” I say to the arms.
The arms don’t do anything.
I strip down and use the jumpsuit to wipe gross stuff from my
body. I found the sponge-bath zone a few days ago—just a sink
with sponges that comes out of the wall. No room for a shower,
I guess. Anyway, I clean up with that stuff.
I’m not sure what to do with the gross, dirty stuff.
“Laundry?” I say.
The arms reach down and take the dirty jumpsuit from my
hands. A panel in the ceiling opens and they put it in there
somewhere. What happens when that fills up? No idea.
I find a replacement jumpsuit in the flotsam and put it on.
Putting on clothes in zero g is interesting. I wouldn’t say it’s
harder, but it’s different. I do manage to get the new jumpsuit
on. It’s a little tight. I check the name patch. It says 姚. It’s one
of Yáo’s jumpsuits. Well, it’s not too tight. And I don’t want to
bounce around the bedroom all day looking for one of mine. I’ll
organize it all later.
For now, I’m too excited to see what’s out there. I mean,
come on! I’m the first human to explore another star system!
And I’m here!
I launch off the floor toward the hatchway…and miss. I crash
into the ceiling. At least I get my arms up in time to protect my
face. I bounce off the ceiling and back to the floor.
“Ow,” I mumble. I try again, this time a little more slowly,
and I’m successful. I coast up through the lab, and into the
control room. Getting around sure is a lot easier when there’s no
gravity. I still feel queasy but I have to admit: This is pretty fun.
I pull myself into the pilot’s chair and strap myself in to keep
from floating away.
The Navigation screen reads   . The
Spin Drive screen says : 0. But most important, the
Petrovascope screen says .
I rub my hands together, then reach for the screen. The
interface is simple enough. The corner has an icon that is a
toggle switch with two states: “Visible” and “Petrova.” It’s
currently set to “Visible.” The rest of the screen shows a visiblelight view from the ship. Seems like an ordinary camera. I poke
at the screen and quickly realize I can pan, zoom in or out,
rotate, and so on.
All I see is stars in the distance. I guess I should pan around
until I find Tau Ceti. I swipe my finger left, left, left…just
generally trying to see where the star is. I don’t have a frame of
reference to work with. Every few left swipes I throw in a down
swipe. Just to cover all angles over time. I do finally find Tau
Ceti, but it doesn’t look like it should.
A few days ago, when I looked at it with the helioscope, it
looked like any other star. But now it’s a solid black circle with
a hazy ring of light around it. I realize why immediately.
The Petrovascope is a pretty sensitive piece of equipment. It’s
fine-tuned to spot even the smallest amounts of the Petrova
wavelength. A star will give off absolutely obscene amounts of
light at all wavelengths. It’d be like staring at the sun with
binoculars. The equipment has to protect itself from the star. It
probably has a physical metal plate that it keeps between its
sensors and the star at all times. So I’m looking at the back of
that plate.
Good design.
I reach up to the toggle switch. This is it. If there’s no Petrova
line here, I don’t know what to do. I mean, I’ll try to figure out
something. But I’ll be kind of lost.
I flip the toggle.
The stars disappear. The hazy ring surrounding Tau Ceti
remains. That’s to be expected. It’s the star’s corona, which will
be emitting plenty of light, so some of it’s bound to be the
Petrova wavelength.
I search the image desperately. Nothing at first, but then I see
it. A beautiful dark-red arch coming out of the bottom-left
portion of Tau Ceti.
I clap my hands. “Yes!”
The shape is unmistakable. It’s a Petrova line! Tau Ceti has a
Petrova line! I do a wiggly little dance in my chair. It’s not easy
in zero g but I give it my all. Now we’re getting somewhere!
There are so many experiments I’ll need to do, I don’t even
know where to begin. I should see where the line leads, for
starters. One of the planets, obviously, but which one and what’s
interesting about it? And I should get a sample of local
Astrophage to see if it’s the same as what we have back on
Earth. I could do that by flying into the Petrova line itself and
then scraping the dust off the hull with an EVA.
I could spend a week just writing up a list of experiments I
want to do!
I spot a flash on the screen. Just a quick blip of light.
“What’s that?” I say. “Another clue?”
The flash happens again. I pan and zoom in on that portion of
space. It’s nowhere near the Petrova line or Tau Ceti. Maybe a
reflection from a planet or asteroid?
I can see how that might happen. A highly reflective asteroid
could be bouncing enough light from Tau Ceti around that I see
it on the Petrovascope, but it’s intermittent, so maybe it’s an
irregular shape that’s rotating and—
The flash becomes a solid light source. It’s just…“on” now.
Nonstop.
I peer at the screen. “What…what’s going on here?…”
The light source becomes brighter. Not instantly. Just
gradually over time. I watch for a minute. It seems to get
brighter faster now.
Is it an object headed toward me?
An instant hypothesis pops into my mind: Maybe Astrophage
are somehow attracted to other Astrophage? Maybe some subset
of them saw the flare from my engines, which would be the
wavelength they use, and they headed toward me. Maybe this is
how they find the main migration group? So this could be a
clump of Astrophage headed my way, thinking I can lead them
to the planet with the carbon dioxide?
Interesting theory. Nothing to back it up, though.
The steady light grows brighter, brighter, brighter, and then
finally disappears.
“Huh,” I say. I wait a few minutes, but the light does not
return.
“Hmm….” I make a mental note of the anomaly. But for now
there’s nothing I can do about it. Whatever it was, it’s gone now.
Back to the Petrova line. The first thing I want to do is find
out which planet the line leads to. I guess I’ll have to work out
how to navigate the ship, but that’s another challenge.
I pan back to look at the Petrova line. Something’s wrong
now. Half of it is just…gone.
It’s coming out of Tau Ceti, just like it was a few minutes
ago, but then it stops abruptly at a seemingly arbitrary point in
space.
“What is going on?”
Did I mess up their migration pattern, maybe? If it’s that
easy, wouldn’t we have worked that out when the Hail Mary was
wandering around our own solar system?
I zoom in on the cutoff point. It’s just a straight line. Like
someone took an X-Acto knife to the whole Petrova line and
threw away the scrap.
A giant line of migrating Astrophage doesn’t just disappear. I
have a simpler explanation: There’s something on the camera
lens. Some blob of debris. Maybe a wad of overexcitable
Astrophage. That would be nice. I’d have a sample to look at
right away!
Maybe a visible-light view will give me a better idea of what’s
going on. I press the toggle button.
And that’s when I see it.
There is an object blocking my view of the Petrova line. It’s
right next to my ship. Maybe a few hundred meters away. It’s
roughly triangle-shaped and it has gable-like protrusions along
its hull.
Yes. I said hull. It’s not an asteroid—the lines are too smooth;
too straight. This object was made. Fabricated. Constructed.
Shapes like that don’t occur in nature.
It’s a ship.
Another ship.
There’s another ship in this system with me. Those flashes of
light—those were its engines. It’s Astrophage-powered. Just like
the Hail Mary. But the design, the shape—it’s nothing like any
spacecraft I’ve ever seen. The whole thing is made of huge, flat
surfaces—the worst possible way to make a pressure vessel. No
one in their right mind would make a ship that shape.
No one on Earth would, anyway.
I blink a few times at what I’m seeing. I gulp.
This…this is an alien spacecraft. Made by aliens. Aliens
intelligent enough to make a spacecraft.
Humanity isn’t alone in the universe. And I’ve just met our
neighbors.
