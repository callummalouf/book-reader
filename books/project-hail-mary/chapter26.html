  <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
  <p>Isat in my cell, staring at the wall.
It wasn’t a dingy jail cell or anything. If anything, it looked
kind of like a college dorm room. Painted brick walls, desk,
chair, bed, en-suite bathroom, et cetera. But the door was steel
and the windows were barred. I wasn’t going anywhere.
Why did the Baikonur launch facility have a jail cell handy? I
don’t know. Ask the Russians.
That launch would be today. Soon, some muscular guards
would come through that door along with a doctor. He’d inject
me with something and that’d be the last time I’d see Earth.
Almost on cue, I heard the clink of the door being unlocked.
A braver person might have seen that as an opportunity. Charge
the door and maybe get past the guards. But I’d given up hope
of escape long ago. What would I do? Run into the Kazakhstani
desert and take my chances?
The door opened and Stratt walked in. The guards closed the
door behind her.
“Hey,” she said.
I glared at her from my bunk.
“The launch is on schedule,” she said. “You’ll be on your way
soon.”
“Whoopee.”
She sat in the chair. “I know you won’t believe this, but it
wasn’t easy for me to do this to you.”
“Yeah, you’re really sentimental.”
She ignored the barb. “Do you know what I studied in
college? What my undergraduate degree was in?”
I shrugged.
“History. I was a history major.” She drummed her fingers on
the desk. “Most people assume I had a science major or
business management. Communications, maybe. But no. It was
history.”
“Doesn’t seem like you.” I sat up on my bunk. “You don’t
spend a lot of time looking backward.”
“I was eighteen years old and had no idea what to do with my
life. I majored in history because I didn’t know what else to do.”
She smirked. “Hard to imagine me like that, eh?”
“Yeah.”
She looked out the barred window toward the launchpad in
the distance. “But I learned a lot. I actually liked it. People
nowadays…they have no idea how good they have it. The past
was unrelenting misery for most people. And the further back in
time you go, the worse it was.”
She stood and meandered around the room. “For fifty
thousand years, right up to the industrial revolution, human
civilization was about one thing and one thing only: food. Every
culture that existed put most of their time, energy, manpower,
and resources into food. Hunting it, gathering it, farming it,
ranching it, storing it, distributing it…it was all about food.
“Even the Roman Empire. Everyone knows about the
emperors, the armies, and the conquests. But what the Romans
really invented was a very efficient system of acquiring farmland
and transportation of food and water.”
She walked to the other side of the room. “The industrial
revolution mechanized agriculture. Since then, we’ve been able
to focus our energies on other things. But that’s only been the
last two hundred years. Before that, most people spent most of
their lives directly dealing with food production.”
“Thanks for the history lesson,” I said. “But if it’s all the same
to you, I’d like my last few moments on Earth to be a little more
pleasant. So…you know…could you leave?”
She ignored me. “Leclerc’s Antarctica nukes bought us some
time. But not much. And there’s only so many times we can
dump chunks of Antarctica into the ocean before the direct
problems of sea-level rise and ocean-biome death cause more
problems than Astrophage. Remember what Leclerc told us:
Half the global population will die.”
“I know,” I muttered.
“No, you don’t know,” she said. “Because it gets a lot worse.”
“Worse than half of humanity dying?”
“Of course,” she said. “Leclerc’s estimate assumes all the
nations of the world work together to share resources and ration
food. But do you think that will happen? Do you think the
United States—the most powerful military force of all time—is
going to sit idly by while half their population starves? How
about China, a nation of 1.3 billion people that’s always on the
verge of famines in the best of times? Do you think they’ll just
leave their militarily weak neighbors alone?”
I shook my head. “There’ll be wars.”
“Yes. There’ll be wars. Fought for the same reason most wars
in ancient times were fought for: food. They’d use religion or
glory or whatever as an excuse, but it was always about food.
Farmlands and people to work that land.
“But the fun doesn’t stop there,” she said. “Because once the
desperate, starving countries start invading each other for food,
the food production will go down. Ever heard of the Tai Ping
rebellion? It was a civil war in China during the nineteenth
century. Four hundred thousand soldiers died in combat. And
twenty million people died from the resulting famine. The war
disrupted agriculture, see? That’s how massive in scale these
things are.”
She wrapped her arms around herself. I’d never seen her look
so vulnerable. “Malnourishment. Disruption. Famine. Every
aspect of infrastructure going to food production and warfare.
The entire fabric of society will fall apart. There’ll be plagues
too. Lots of them. All over the world. Because the medical-care
systems will be overwhelmed. Once easily contained outbreaks
will go unchecked.”
She turned to face me. “War, famine, pestilence, and death.
Astrophage is literally the apocalypse. The Hail Mary is all we
have now. I’ll make any sacrifice to give it even the tiniest
additional chance of success.”
I lay down on my bunk and faced away from her. “Whatever
lets you sleep at night.”
She walked back to the door and knocked on it. A guard
opened it up. “Anyway. I just wanted you to know why I’m
doing this. I owed you that.”
“Go to hell.”
“Oh, I will, believe me. You three are going to Tau Ceti. The
rest of us are going to hell. More accurately, hell is coming to
us.”
—
Yeah? Well, hell’s coming back to you, Stratt. In the form of
me. I’m hell.
I mean…I don’t know what I’ll say to her. But I definitely
plan to say stuff. Mean stuff.
I’m eighteen days into my nearly four-year journey. I’m just
now reaching Tau Ceti’s heliopause—the edge of the star’s
powerful magnetic field. At least, the edge of where it’s strong
enough to deflect fast-moving interstellar radiation. From now
on, the radiation load on the hull will be much higher.
Doesn’t matter to me. I’m surrounded by Astrophage. But it’s
interesting to see the external radiation sensors go up and up
and up. It’s progress, at least. But in the grand scheme of things,
I’m on a long road trip and my current status is “just walking
out the front door of the house.”
I’m bored. I’m by myself in a spaceship without much to do.
I clean and catalog the lab again. I might come up with some
research experiments for either Astrophage or Taumoeba. Heck,
I could write some papers while I’m on my way home. Oh, and
there’s the matter of the intelligent alien life-form I hung out
with for a couple of months. I might want to jot a few things
down about him too.
I do have a huge collection of video games. I have every piece
of software that was available when we built the ship. I’m sure
they can keep me busy for a while.
I check the Taumoeba farms. All ten of them are doing just
fine. I feed them Astrophage from time to time, just to keep
them healthy and breeding. The farms emulate Venus’s
atmosphere, so as the generations of Taumoeba go by, they’ll get
even better at Venusian life. After four years of this, by the time
I drop them off at the planet, they’ll be well suited for it.
And yes, I’ve already decided I’ll drop them off. Why not?
I have no idea what kind of world I’ll be returning to.
Thirteen years have passed on Earth since I left, and they’ll
experience another thirteen before I get back. Twenty-six years.
All my students will be adults. I hope they all survive. But I
have to admit…some probably won’t. I try not to dwell.
Anyway, once I get back to my solar system, I may as well
swing by Venus and drop off the Taumoeba. Not sure how I’ll
seed it, but I have a few ideas. The simplest is just to wad up a
ball of Taumoeba-infested Astrophage and throw it at Venus.
The Astrophage will absorb the heat of reentry and the
Taumoeba will be released into the wild. Then they’ll have a
field day. Venus must be Astrophage-central by now, and lord
knows Taumoeba can get right to work once they find their prey.
I check my food stores. I’m still on schedule. I have another
three months of real, edible food packs left, and then it’ll be
coma slurry from then on.
I’m reluctant to go back into a coma. I’ve got the genes to
survive it, but so did Yáo and Ilyukhina. Why risk death if I
don’t have to?
Also, I can’t be 100 percent sure I correctly reprogrammed
the course navigation. I think it’s right, and whenever I spotcheck, I’m still on course toward home. But what if something
goes wrong while I’m in a coma? What if I wake up and I
missed the solar system by a light-year?
But between isolation, loneliness, and disgusting food, I may
be willing to take those risks eventually. We’ll see.
Speaking of loneliness, my thoughts turn back to Rocky. My
only friend now. Seriously. He’s my only friend. I didn’t have
much of a social life back when things were normal. Sometimes
I’d grab dinner with other faculty and staff at the school. I’d
have the occasional Saturday-night beer with old college friends.
But thanks to time dilation, when I get home all those folks will
be a generation older than me.
I liked Dimitri. He was probably my favorite of the whole
Hail Mary gang. But who knows what he’s up to now? Heck,
Russia and the United States may be at war. Or they may be
allies in a war. I have no idea.
I climb the ladder to the control room. I sit in the pilot’s seat
and bring up the Nav panel. I really shouldn’t do this, but it’s
become a bit of a ritual. I shut off the spin drives and coast.
Gravity immediately disappears, but I hardly notice. I’m used to
it.
With the spin drives off, I can safely use the Petrovascope. I
scan around in space for a bit—I know where to look. I quickly
find it. The little dot of Petrova-frequency light. The Blip-A’s
engines. If I were within a hundred kilometers of that light, my
entire ship would be vaporized.
I’m on one side of the system and he’s on the other. Heck,
even Tau Ceti itself just looks like a lightbulb in the distance.
But I can still clearly make out the Blip-A’s engine flare. Using
light as a propellant releases a simply absurd amount of power.
Maybe that’s something we could use in the future. Maybe
Earth and Erid could communicate with massive releases of
Petrova light thanks to Astrophage. I wonder how much it would
take to make a flash visible from 40 Eridani. We could talk in
Morse code or something. They have a copy of Wikipedia now.
They’d work out what we’re up to when they saw the flashes.
Still, our “conversation” would be slow. 40 Eridani is sixteen
light-years away from Earth. So if we sent a message like “Hey,
how ya doin’?” it would be thirty-two years before we got their
reply.
I stare at the little point of light on the screen and sigh. I’ll be
able to track him for quite a while. I know where his ship will
be at any given moment. He’ll use the exact flight plan I gave
him. He trusts my science as much as I trust his engineering.
But after a few months, the Petrovascope won’t be able to see
the light anymore. Not because the light is too dim—it’s a very
sensitive instrument. It won’t be able to see him because our
relative velocities will cause a red-shift in the light coming off
his drives. It won’t be the Petrova wavelength anymore when it
gets to me.
What? Would I do a ridiculous amount of relativistic math to
calculate our relative velocity at any given moment as perceived
by my inertial reference frame and then do Lorentz
transformations to figure out when the light from his engines
will drop out of the Petrovascope’s perception range? Just so I
know how much longer I can see my friend in the distance?
Wouldn’t that be kind of pathetic?
Yeah.
Okay, my sad little daily ritual is over. I turn off the
Petrovascope and fire up the spin drives again.
—
I check my dwindling supply of real food. I’ve been “on the
road” for thirty-two days now. According to my calculations,
fifty-one days from now I’ll be completely reliant on coma
slurry.
I go to the dormitory. “Computer. Provide coma food
substance sample.”
The mechanical arms reach into their supply area and come
back with a bag of white powder and drop it on the bunk.
I pick up the bag. Of course it’s a powder. Why would they
include the liquid in the long-term storage? The water system of
the Hail Mary is a closed loop. Water goes into me, it comes out
of me in various ways, and then it’s purified and reused.
I take the package to the lab, open it up, and pour some
powder in a beaker.
I add a little water, give it a stir, and it becomes a milky-white
slurry. I give it a sniff. It doesn’t really smell like anything. So I
take a sip.
It takes effort, but I resist the urge to spit it out. It tastes like
aspirin. That nasty pill-like taste. I’m going to have to eat this
Bitter Pill Chow™ every meal for several years.
Maybe a coma isn’t that bad.
I set the beaker aside. I’ll deal with that misery when the time
comes. For now, I’m going to work on the beetles.
I have four little Taumoeba farms, courtesy of Rocky. Each
one is a steel-ish capsule no larger than my hand. I say “steelish” because it’s some Eridian alloy of steel that humans haven’t
invented yet. It’s much harder than any metal alloys we have,
but not harder than diamond-cutting tools.
We went back and forth on the mini-farm casing. The
obvious first choice was to make it out of xenonite. The problem
is: How would Earth scientists get in? None of our tools would
be able to cut it. The only option would be extremely high heat.
And that risks harming the Taumoeba inside.
I suggested a xenonite container with a lid. Something that
could be clamped down tight like a pressure door. I’d leave
instructions on the USB stick on how to safely open it. Rocky
rejected that idea right away. No matter how good the seal was,
it wouldn’t be perfect. Over the two years that the farm will
experience during the trip, enough air could leak out to
suffocate the Taumoeba inside. He insisted the whole farm be a
single, completely sealed container. Probably a good idea.
So we settled on Eridian steel. It’s strong, it doesn’t oxidize
easily, and it’s extremely durable. Earth can cut it open with a
diamond saw. And hey, they’ll probably analyze it to learn how
to make their own. Everyone wins!
His approach for the farms themselves was simple. Inside,
there’s an active colony of Taumoeba and a Venus-like
atmosphere. Also, there’s a coil of very thin steel-ish tubing full
of Astrophage. The Taumoeba can only get at the outermost
layer, so they have to work their way down the tube, which has a
total length of about 20 meters. Some basic experimentation
tells us that will last the small Taumoeba population several
years. As for waste products—they’ll just stew in their own
poop. The capsule will gain methane and lose carbon dioxide
over time, but it doesn’t matter. Though it’s a small volume by
human standards, it’s a vast, gigantic cavern to the tiny microbes
inside.
The beetles have been a priority for me. I want them ready
for launch at a moment’s notice. Just in case there’s a
catastrophic problem with the Hail Mary. But I don’t want to
send them off if there isn’t a mission-critical problem. The
closer we are to Earth when they launch, the better their odds of
making it there safely.
In addition to installing the mini-farms, I also have to refuel
the little buggers. I’d used almost half their fuel supply when
they served as ad-hoc engines for the Hail Mary. But they only
need 60 kilograms of Astrophage each to be full. Barely a drop
in the bucket compared to my supply of imported, Eridianmade Astrophage.
The hardest part is opening the beetle’s little fuel bay. Like
everything else around here, it wasn’t intended for reuse. It’s like
adding fresh butane to a Bic lighter. It’s just not meant for that.
It’s completely sealed. I have to clamp it into the mill and use a
6-millimeter bit to get in…it’s a whole big thing. But I’m getting
good at it.
I finished John and Paul yesterday. Today I’m working on
Ringo and, time permitting, George. George will be the easiest.
I don’t need to refuel him—I never used him as an engine. I just
have to attach the mini-farm.
Figuring out where to put the mini-farm was another matter.
Even with its small size, it’s too big to fit inside the little probe.
So I epoxy it to the undercarriage. Then I spot-weld a small
counterweight to the top of the beetle. The computer inside has
very strong opinions about where the center of mass of the
probe is. It’s easier to add a counterweight than completely
reprogram a guidance system.
Which brings us to the matter of weight.
The additional weight of the farm makes the beetles weigh a
kilogram more than they should. That’s okay. I remember
countless meetings with Steve Hatch discussing the design. He’s
a weird little guy, but he’s a heck of a rocket scientist. The
beetles know their location in space by looking at the stars, and
if they have less fuel than they expected to have, they taper their
acceleration down as needed.
In short: They’ll get home. It’ll just take a little longer. I ran
the numbers and it’s a trivial difference in Earth time. Though
the beetles will experience several additional months during the
trip than the original plan.
I go to the supply cabinet and pull out the BOCOA (big ol’
container of Astrophage). It’s a lightproof metal bin with
wheels. There are several hundred kilograms of Astrophage in
there and I’m in 1.5 g’s of gravity. That’s why I added the
wheels. You’d be amazed what you can do with a machine shop
and a firm desire not to drag heavy stuff around.
I hold the handle with a towel because it’s so hot. I wheel it
over to the lab table, settle into the chair, and get ready for the
methodical refueling process. I get the plastic syringe at the
ready. With it, I can squirt 100 milliliters of Astrophage into
that 6-millimeter hole per shot. That’s about 600 grams. All
told, I have to do it about two hundred times per beetle.
I open the BOCOA and—
“Ugh!” I wince and draw away from the container. It smells
horrible.
“Uh…” I say. “Why does it smell like that?”
Then it hits me. I know that smell. It’s the smell of dead,
rotting Astrophage.
The Taumoeba are loose again.</p>
