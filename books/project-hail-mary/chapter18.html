  <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
  <p>The crew of the Hail Mary sat on the couch in the break
room, each with their drink of choice.
Commander Yáo had a German beer, Engineer Ilyukhina had
a distressingly large tumbler of vodka, and Science Specialist
DuBois had a glass of 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon that he had
poured ten minutes in advance to ensure it had time to breathe.
The break room itself had been a struggle to arrange. Stratt
didn’t like anything that wasn’t directly related to the mission,
and an aircraft carrier wasn’t exactly overflowing with extra
space. Still, with more than a hundred scientists from all over
the world demanding a place to relax, she had relented. A small
room in the corner of the hangar deck was built to house the
“extravagance.”
Dozens of people crowded into the room and watched the TV
feed on the wall-mounted monitor. By silent agreement, the
crew got to sit on the couch. The crew got all possible perks and
privileges. They were sacrificing their lives for humanity. The
least we could do was give them the best seats.
“And we’re just minutes away from lift-off,” said the BBC
reporter. We could have watched American news, Chinese
news, Russian news, it would have all been the same. The long
shot of Baikonur Cosmodrome interspersed with shots of the
huge launch vehicle on the pad.
The reporter stood in the observation room overlooking
Moscow’s Mission Control Center. “Today’s launch is the ninth
in a total of sixteen total launches for Project Hail Mary, but it
is arguably the most important one. This payload contains the
cockpit, lab, and dormitory modules. Astronauts on ISS are
ready to receive the modules and will spend the next two weeks
positioning them on the Hail Mary’s frame, which was built over
the last several expeditions…”
Ilyukhina raised her vodka. “Do not fuck up my house,
Roscosmos bastards!”
“Aren’t they your friends?” I asked.
“They can be both!” She bellowed with laughter.
The countdown came on-screen. Less than a minute to go.
Yáo leaned forward and peered intently. It must have been
hard—a military man of action forced to passively watch
something so important play out.
DuBois saw Yáo’s expression. “I’m certain the launch will go
well, Commander Yáo.”
“Mm,” said Yáo.
“Thirty seconds to launch,” said Ilyukhina. “I cannot wait that
long.” She downed her vodka and immediately poured herself
another glass.
The assembled scientists pressed forward a bit as the
countdown continued. I found myself pinned against the back of
the couch. But I was too focused on the screen to care.
DuBois craned his neck to look back at me. “Will Ms. Stratt
not be joining us?”
“I don’t think so,” I said. “She doesn’t care about fun stuff
like launches. She’s probably going over spreadsheets in her
office or something.”
He nodded. “Then it’s fortunate that we have you here. To
represent her, in a way.”
“Me? Represent her? How did you get that idea?”
Ilyukhina spun her head to face me. “You are number two,
no? You are first officer of Project Hail Mary?”
“What? No! I’m just one of the scientists. Like all these
guys.” I gestured to the men and women behind me.
Ilyukhina and DuBois looked at each other and then back to
me. “You honestly think this?” she said.
Bob Redell spoke up behind me. “You’re not like the rest of
us, Grace.”
I shrugged at him. “Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I be?”
“The point is,” DuBois said, “you are, somehow, special to
Ms. Stratt. I had assumed you two were engaged in sexual
congress.”
My mouth fell agape. “Wha—what?! Are you out of your
mind?! No! No way!”
“Huh,” said Ilyukhina. “Perhaps you should be? She is
uptight. She could use good roll in hay.”
“Oh my God. Is that what people think?” I turned to face the
scientists. Most of them averted their eyes. “Nothing like that is
going on! And I’m not her number two! I’m just a scientist—
drafted into this project like the rest of you!”
Yáo turned around and stared at me for a moment. The room
fell silent. He didn’t speak much, so when he did, people paid
attention.
“You are the number two,” he said. Then he turned back to
the screen.
The BBC announcer counted the last few seconds along with
the on-screen timer. “Three…two…one…and we have lift-off!”
Flames and smoke surrounded the rocket on-screen, and it
rose skyward. Slow at first, then picking up more and more
speed.
Ilyukhina held her glass up for a few seconds and finally burst
into cheers. “Tower is clear! Launch is good!” She gulped her
vodka.
“It’s only a hundred feet off the ground,” I said. “Maybe wait
till it reaches orbit?”
DuBois sipped his wine. “Astronauts celebrate when the
tower is clear.”
Without a word, Yáo took a sip of his beer.
—
“Why. Doesn’t. This. Work?!” I hit my forehead with both
palms at each word.
I flop into the lab chair, deflated.
Rocky watches from his tunnel above. “No predator,
question?”
“No predator.” I sigh.
The experiment is simple enough. It’s a glass bulb full of
Adrian’s air. The air didn’t actually come from Adrian, but the
proportions of gases are based on the spectrograph of its
atmosphere. The pressure is very low—one-tenth atmosphere,
like the upper atmosphere of Adrian must be.
Also inside the bulb is our collected Adrian life-forms and
some fresh Astrophage. I hoped that providing a bunch of nice,
juicy Astrophage would make the predator population spike and
I could isolate it from the sample once it was the dominant cell
type present.
Didn’t work.
“You are certain, question?”
I check my makeshift heat-energy indicator. It’s just a
thermocouple with part of it sticking in ice water and part of it
attached to the bulb. Heat energy is provided by Astrophage and
consumed by the ice. The resulting temperature of the
thermocouple tells me how much total heat energy the
Astrophage is giving off. If the temperature goes down, it means
the Astrophage population went down. But that’s not happening.
“Yeah, I’m sure,” I say. “No change in Astrophage
population.”
“Maybe temperature of bulb no good. Too hot. Adrian upper
atmosphere is probably much colder than you room temperature.”
I shake my head. “Adrian air temperature shouldn’t matter.
The predator has to be able to handle Astrophage temperature.”
“Ah. Yes. You are right.”
“Maybe the predator theory is wrong,” I say.
He clicks across the tunnel to the far side of the lab. He paces
when he thinks. Interesting that humans and Eridians would
both have that behavior. “Predators is only explanation. Maybe
predators no live in Petrova line. Maybe predators live further
down in atmosphere.”
I perk up. “Maybe.”
I look over to the lab monitor. I have it showing the external
camera view of Adrian. Not for any scientific reason—just
because it looks cool. Right this moment we’re about to cross
the terminator into the day side of the planet. The light of
orbital dawn glows along an arc.
“Okay, let’s say the predator lives in the atmosphere. What
altitude?”
“What altitude is best, question? If you predator, where you go,
question? You go to Astrophage.”
“Okay, so what altitude are the Astrophage at?” The question
answers itself. “Ah! There’s a breeding altitude. Where air has
enough carbon dioxide for Astrophage to breed.”
“Yes!” He clatters back up his tunnel and stands above me.
“We can find. Easy. Use Petrovascope.”
I slam my fist into my palm. “Yes! Of course!”
Astrophage have to breed somewhere. Some partial pressure
of carbon dioxide will be key. But we don’t have to work that
out or take any guesses. When an Astrophage divides, it and its
offspring head back to Tau Ceti. And they use IR-light emission
to make it happen. That means there will be a glow of Petrovafrequency light coming from all over the planet at that specific
altitude.
“To the control room!” I say.
“Control room!” He scampers across the lab ceiling tunnel and
disappears through his personal control-room entrance. I follow
along beside but I’m not quite as fast.
I climb up the ladder, take the pilot’s seat, and flip on the
Petrovascope. Rocky has already taken up position in his bulb
and points his camera at my main screen.
The entire screen glows red.
“What is this, question? No data.”
“Wait,” I say. I bring up the controls and options and start
moving sliders. “We’re inside the Petrova line. There’s
Astrophage all around us. Let me just change the setting to only
show the brightest sources….”
It takes a lot of manipulation, but I finally manage to get the
brightness range set. What I’m left with are irregular blotchy
areas of IR light coming from Adrian.
“I think this is our answer,” I say.
Rocky gets closer to his textured screen to “see” what I’m
looking at.
“Not what I expected,” I say.
I thought it would just be a general layer of IR glow at a given
altitude. But it’s nothing like that. The clumps are basically
clouds. And they don’t match up with the wispy white clouds I
can see with visible light. These are, for lack of a better term,
IR clouds.
Or, more accurately, clouds of Astrophage that are emitting
IR. For whatever reason, Astrophage breed much more in some
areas than others.
“Unusual distribution,” says Rocky, echoing my own thoughts.
“Yes. Maybe the weather affects breeding?”
“Maybe. Can you calculate altitude, question?”
“Yes. Wait.”
I zoom and pan the Petrovascope until I’m looking at an
Astrophage cloud right on the horizon of Adrian. The readouts
show the camera’s current angle with respect to the axes of the
ship. I jot those angles down and switch to the navigation
console. It tells me the angle of the ship relative to the center of
our orbit. With that information, and a whole bunch of
trigonometry, I can work out the altitude of the Astrophage
clouds.
“The breeding altitude is 91.2 kilometers from the surface.
The width is less than 200 meters.”
Rocky folds one of his claws over the other. I know that body
language. He’s thinking. “If predators exist, predators are there.”
“Agreed,” I say. “But how do we get a sample?”
“How close can orbit get, question?”
“One hundred kilometers from the planet. Any closer and the
ship will burn up in the atmosphere.”
“This is unfortunate,” Rocky says. “Eight point eight kilometers
away from breeding zone. No can get closer, question?”
“If we hit the atmosphere at orbital speed, we die. But what if
we slow down?”
“Slow down means orbit no good. Fall into air. Die.”
I lean over the armrest to look at him. “We can use the
engines to keep from falling into the atmosphere. Just thrust
constantly away from the planet. Lower ourselves into the
atmosphere, get a sample, and then leave.”
“No work. We die.”
“Why no work?”
“Engines give off enormous IR light. If you use in air, air
become ions. Explosion. Destroy ship.”
I wince. “Right, of course.”
Back when Dimitri first tested a spin drive, it was only on for
100 microseconds and it melted a metric ton of metallic silicon
behind it. And that test drive was one-thousandth the power of
the Hail Mary’s engines. Everything works fine when I’m in a
vacuum. But using the engines in air would create a fireball that
makes a nuclear bomb look like a firecracker.
We sit in frustrated silence for a while. The salvation of both
our worlds might be just 10 kilometers below us, and we can’t
get to it. There has to be a way. But how? We don’t even need to
be there. We just need to get a sample of the air there.
Anything, no matter how small.
Wait a minute.
“How do you make xenonite again? You mix two liquids?”
Rocky is caught off guard by the question, but he answers.
“Yes. Have liquid and liquid. Mix. They become xenonite.”
“How much can you make? How much of those liquids did
you bring?”
“I bring much. I use to make my zone.”
I bring up a spreadsheet and start typing in numbers. “We
need 0.4 cubic meters of xenonite. Can you make that much?”
“Yes,” he says. “Have enough liquids remain to make 0.61
cubic meters.”
“Okay. Then I have…an idea.” I steeple my fingers.
—
It’s a simple idea, but also stupid. Thing is, when stupid ideas
work, they become genius ideas. We’ll see which way this one
falls.
The Astrophage breeding grounds are 10 kilometers into the
atmosphere of Adrian. I can’t fly the Hail Mary that low because
the air is too thick and I’d burn up. I can’t use the engines in the
atmosphere because then all heck breaks loose and everything
blows up.
So, it’s time to go fishing. We’re going to make a 10-
kilometer-long chain, put a sampling device of some kind on
the end (Rocky will make that), and drag it through the
atmosphere. Easy enough, right?
Wrong.
The Hail Mary has to maintain a velocity of 12.6 kilometers
per second to stay in orbit. Any slower and we’ll decay and burn
up. But if we drag a chain through the air at that velocity—even
a xenonite chain—it’ll get torn up and vaporized.
So we have to go slower. But going slower means falling
toward the planet. Unless I use the engines to constantly
maintain altitude. But if I do that, I’d be thrusting directly away
from the chain and sample device. The exhaust from the engines
will vaporize all of it.
So we’ll thrust at an angle. Simple as that.
It’ll look absolutely ridiculous. The Hail Mary will be tilted to
30 degrees from vertical, thrusting upward at that angle. Below
it, the chain will dangle 10 kilometers into the air straight down.
The atmosphere behind the thrusters will be in a constant state
of ionized fire. It should be quite a show. But it’ll be behind us
and the chain will be passing through unaffected air.
All told, our lateral velocity will be just over 100 meters per
second. The chain can handle that speed in the thin high-altitude
air, no problem. I calculated that it’ll only deflect about 2
degrees from vertical.
Once we feel like we have a sample, we skedaddle. What
could possibly go wrong!
I say that ironically.
I’m not the greatest 3-D modeler, but I’m able to make a
chain link in CAD reasonably well. It’s not a normal oval link,
though. It’s mostly oval, but with a thin opening for another link
to enter. Easy to assemble the links, but extremely unlikely for
them to rattle apart. Especially when they’re under tension.
I grab a block of aluminum and mount it in the mill.
“This will work, question?” Rocky asks from his ceiling
tunnel.
“It should,” I say.
I fire up the mill and it gets right to work. It drills out the
mold for a chain link exactly the way I’d hoped.
I pull the workpiece out, dust off the aluminum shavings, and
hold it up to the tunnel. “How’s this?”
“Very good!” Rocky says. “We will need many many many
chain links. More molds means I can make more at one time. You
can make many molds, question?”
“Well.” I look in the supply cabinet. “I have limited amounts
of aluminum.”
“You have many items in ship you no use. Two beds in
dormitory, for instance. Melt them, make blocks, make more
molds.”
“Wow. You don’t do anything by half-measure, do you?”
“No understand.”
“I’m not going to melt a bunch of stuff. How would I even do
that?”
“Astrophage. Melt anything.”
“You got me there,” I say. “But no. The heat would be too
much for my life-support system to handle. That reminds me.
Why do you have so much extra Astrophage?”
He pauses. “Strange story.”
I perk up. Always up for a strange story. He clicks along his
tunnel and sits in a slightly wider section. “Science Eridians do
much math. Calculate trip. More fuel mean faster trip. So we
make much much much Astrophage.”
“How’d you make so much? Earth had a very difficult time
making it.”
“Was easy. Put in metal balls with carbon dioxide. Put in
ocean. Wait. Astrophage double, double, double. Much
Astrophage.”
“Riiight. Because your oceans are hotter than Astrophage.”
“Yes. Earth oceans are not. Sad.”
When it comes to Astrophage manufacturing, Erid was born
on third base. The whole planet is a pressure cooker. Twenty-
nine atmospheres at 210 degrees Celsius means water is liquid
on the surface. And their oceans are far, far hotter than the
Astrophage critical temperature. They just put Astrophage in
the water, let it absorb heat, and breed.
I’m jealous. We had to pave the Sahara Desert to breed up
our Astrophage. All they had to do was throw it in the water.
The stored heat energy of Erid’s oceans is ridiculous. A whole
bunch of water—multiples of Earth’s total oceans—holding a
temperature around 200 degrees Celsius or more. That’s a lot of
energy.
And that’s why they can take a century or so to solve the
problem while Earth is going to freeze in a few decades. It’s not
just their air storing heat. Their oceans store even more. Born
on third base. Again.
“Science Eridians design ship and fuel requirements. Journey
to take 6.64 years.”
That trips me up for a moment. 40 Eridani is ten light-years
away from Tau Ceti, so you can’t get from one to the other in
less than ten years from Erid’s point of view. He must mean
6.64 years of time experienced by his ship thanks to time
dilation.
“Strange things happen on trip. Crew sick. Die.” His voice
lowers. “Now I know was radiation.”
I look down and give him a moment.
“Everyone sick. I alone to run ship. More strange things
happen. Engines not work right. I am engine expert. I cannot
figure out problem.”
“Your engines failed?”
“No. Not fail. Thrust normal. But speed…not increase. No can
explain.”
“Huh.”
He clatters back and forth as he talks. “Then more strange:
Reach halfway point earlier than should. Much earlier. I turn
ship around. Thrust to slow down. But Tau get farther away.
How? Still moving toward Tau but Tau moving away. Much
confusion.”
“Uh-oh,” I say. A thought creeps into my head. A very
disturbing thought.
“I speed up. Slow down. Much confuse. But get here. Even with
all mistakes and confusion, I get here in three years. Half of time
science Eridian say should be. So much confuse.”
“Oh…oh my…” I mumble.
“Much much much fuel remain. Much more than should have.
No complain. But confuse.”
“Yeah…” I say. “Tell me this: Is time on Erid the same as
time on your ship?”
He cocks his carapace. “Question make no sense. Of course
time is same. Time is same everywhere.”
I put my head in my hands. “Oh boy.”
Eridians don’t know about relativistic physics.
They calculated their entire journey with Newtonian physics.
They worked it all out by assuming they could just accelerate
faster and faster and the speed of light wasn’t an issue.
They don’t know about time dilation. Rocky doesn’t realize
that Erid experienced a whole bunch more time than he did on
that trip. They don’t know about length dilation. The distance to
Tau Ceti will actually increase as you slow down relative to it—
even if you’re still going toward it.
An entire planet of intelligent people put together a ship
based on incorrect scientific assumptions, and by some miracle,
the sole survivor of the crew was clever enough at trial-anderror problem solving to actually get it to its destination.
And out of that major screw-up comes my salvation. They
thought they’d need a whole lot more fuel. So Rocky has
boatloads to spare.
“Okay, Rocky,” I say. “Get comfortable. I have a lot of
science to explain.”
—
He knocked twice and leaned into my office. “Dr. Grace? Are
you Dr. Grace?”
It wasn’t a large office, but you’re lucky to have any personal
space at all on an aircraft carrier. Before it held the high honor
of being my office, the room was a storage locker for bathroom
supplies. The crew had three thousand butts that needed daily
wiping. I got to keep the room as my office until the next time
we were in port. Then they’d fill it up with more supplies.
I was approximately as critical as toilet paper.
I looked up from my laptop. The short, somewhat disheveled
man at the door waved awkwardly.
“Yeah,” I said. “I’m Grace. You are…?”
“Hatch. Steve Hatch. University of British Columbia. Nice to
meet ya.”
I gestured to the folding chair in front of the folding table I
used as a desk.
He shuffled in, carrying a bulbous metal object. I’d never seen
anything like it. He plunked it on my table.
I looked at the object. It was like someone had flattened a
medicine ball, added a triangle to one end, and a trapezoid to
the other.
He sat in the chair and stretched his arms. “Man, that was
weird. I’ve never been on a helicopter before. Have you? Well,
of course you have. How else would you get here? I mean, I
guess you could have used a boat, but probably not. I hear they
keep the carrier far away from land in case there’s a disaster
during Astrophage experiments. A boat would have been nicer,
honestly, that helicopter ride almost made me puke. But I’m not
complaining. I’m just happy to be involved.”
“Um”—I gestured to the object on my desk—“what is this
thing?”
He somehow became even more energetic. “Ah, right! That’s
a beetle! Well, a prototype for one, anyway. My team and I
think we have most of the kinks worked out. Well, you never
have all the kinks worked out, but we’re ready for actual engine
tests. And the university said we had to do those here on the
carrier. Also the provincial government of British Columbia said
it. Oh, and the national government of Canada said it too. I’m
Canadian, by the way. But don’t worry! I’m not one of those
anti-American Canadians. I think you guys are all right.”
“Beetle?”
“Yeah!” He picked it up and turned the trapezoid toward me.
“This is how the Hail Mary crew will send us back the
information. It’s a little self-contained spacecraft that will
automatically navigate itself back to Earth from Tau Ceti. Well,
from anywhere, really. That’s what me and my team have been
working on for the past year.”
I peek into the trapezoid and see a shiny glasslike surface. “Is
that a spin drive?” I asked.
“Sure is! Man, those Russians know their stuff. We just used
their designs and everything came out great. At least, I think it
did. We haven’t tested the spin drive yet. The tricky part is
navigation and steering.”
He turned the device around and faced the triangular head
toward me. “This is where the cameras and computer are. No
fancy-schmancy inertial-navigation nonsense. It uses ordinary
visible light to see the stars. It identifies constellations and works
out its orientation from that.” He tapped the center of the
bulbous carapace. “There’s a little DC generator in here. As
long as we have Astrophage, we have power.”
“What can it carry?” I ask.
“Data. It’s got a redundant RAID array with more memory
storage than anyone would ever need.” He knocked on the
dome. It echoed slightly. “The bulk of this puppy is fuel storage.
It’ll need about 125 kilos of Astrophage to make the trip. Seems
like a lot but…man…twelve light-years!”
I lifted the device and hefted it in my hands a couple of
times. “How does it turn?”
“Reaction wheels inside,” he said. “It spins them one way, the
ship turns the other. Easy-peasy.”
“Interstellar navigation is ‘easy-peasy’?” I smiled.
He snickered. “Well, for what we have to do, yeah. It has a
receiver that’s constantly listening for a signal from Earth. Once
it hears that signal, it’ll broadcast its location and await
instructions from the Deep Space Network. We don’t have to be
super accurate with the navigation. We just need it to show up
within radio range of Earth. Anywhere within the orbit of
Saturn or so will do just fine.”
I nod. “And then scientists can tell it exactly how to get back.
Clever.”
He shrugged. “They’ll probably do that, yeah. But they don’t
need to. They’ll have it radio over all the data first thing. The
information gets across. Then they can collect it later if they
want. Oh, and we’re making four of these. All we need is for
one of them to survive the trip.”
I turned the beetle this way and that. It was surprisingly light.
A few pounds at most. “Okay, so there are four of these. How
likely is each one to survive the trip? Is there at least a little
system redundancy aboard?”
He shrugged. “Not that much, no. But it doesn’t have to travel
for nearly as long as the Hail Mary does. So stuff doesn’t have to
survive as long.”
“It’s going the same route, right?” I asked. “Why doesn’t it
take the same time?”
“Because the Hail Mary’s acceleration is limited by the soft,
squishy humans inside. The beetle doesn’t have that problem.
Everything aboard is military-grade cruise-missile electronics
and parts that can handle hundreds of g’s of force. So it gets to
relativistic speed much faster.”
“Oh, interesting…” I wondered if this would make a good
question for my students. I dismissed the idea immediately. It
was absurdly complicated math no eighth grader would be able
to handle.
“Yeah,” Hatch said. “They accelerate at five hundred g’s until
they reach a cruising speed of 0.93 c. It’ll take over twelve years
to get back to Earth, but all told the little guys will only
experience about twenty months. Do you believe in God? I
know it’s a personal question. I do. And I think He was pretty
awesome to make relativity a thing, don’t you? The faster you
go, the less time you experience. It’s like He’s inviting us to
explore the universe, you know?”
He fell silent and stared at me.
“Well,” I said. “This is really impressive. Good work.”
“Thanks!” he said. “So can I have some Astrophage to test
it?”
“Sure,” I said. “How much you want?”
“How about a hundred milligrams?”
I drew back. “Easy there, cowboy. That’s a lot of energy.”
“All right, all right. Can’t blame a guy for trying. How about
one milligram?”
“Yeah, I can swing that.”
He clapped. “Hell yeah! Astrophage comin’ my way!” He
leaned forward to me. “Isn’t it amazing? Astrophage, I mean?
It’s like…the coolest thing ever! Again, God’s just handing us
the future!”
“Cool?” I said. “It’s an extinction-level event. If anything,
God’s handing us the apocalypse.”
He shrugged. “I mean, maybe a little. But man. Perfect
energy storage! Imagine a battery-powered household. Like—
you have a double-A battery, but full of Astrophage. That’d last
your house about a hundred thousand years. Imagine buying a
car and never having to charge it up? The entire concept of
power grids is going to end. And it’ll all be clean, renewable
energy once we start breeding the stuff on the moon or
something. All it needs is sunlight!”
“Clean? Renewable?” I said. “Are you suggesting Astrophage
will be…good for the environment? Because it won’t be. Even if
Hail Mary finds a solution, we’re looking at a mass extinction.
Twenty years from now, a whole bunch of species on Earth will
be extinct. And we’re working hard to make sure humans aren’t
one of them.”
He waved off my comment. “Earth’s had five mass extinction
events in the past. And humans are clever. We’ll pull through.”
“We’ll starve!” I said. “Billions of people are going to starve.”
“Naaaah,” he said. “We’re already stockpiling food. We’ve
got a bunch of methane in the air to hold in the solar energy.
It’ll be all right. As long as Hail Mary succeeds.”
I just stared at him for a moment. “You are, without a doubt,
the most optimistic person I’ve ever met.”
He gave me a double thumbs-up. “Thanks!”
He picked up the beetle and turned to leave. “Come on, Pete,
let’s get you some Astrophage!”
“Pete?” I asked.
He looked over his shoulder. “Sure. I’m naming them after
the Beatles. The British rock group.”
“I take it you’re a fan?”
He turned back to face me. “Fan? Oh, yes. I don’t want to
exaggerate, but Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is the
greatest musical accomplishment in the history of mankind. I
know, I know. Many would disagree. But they’re wrong.”
“Fair enough,” I said. “But why Pete? Aren’t the Beatles
named John, Paul, George, and Ringo?”
“Sure. And that’s what we’ll call the ones aboard the Hail
Mary. But this fella is for testing in low Earth orbit. I get a
whole SpaceX launch just for me! Isn’t that amazing! Anyway, I
named him after Pete Best—he was the drummer for the
Beatles before Ringo.”
“Okay, I didn’t know that,” I said.
“Now you do. I’m gonna get that Astrophage now. I’ve got to
make sure these beetles will be able to…‘Get Back.’ ”
“Okay.”
He frowned. “ ‘Get Back.’ It’s a song. It’s by the Beatles.”
“Sure. Okay.”
He spun on his heel and left. “Some people got no
appreciation for the classics.”
I was left confused in his wake. Pretty sure I wasn’t the first.</p>
