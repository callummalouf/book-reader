  <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
  <p>Okay, take a breath. Let’s not jump to wild conclusions.
Yes, the gravity is too high. Work from there and think of
sensible answers.
I could be in a centrifuge. It would have to be pretty big. But
with Earth’s gravity providing 1 g, you could have these rooms
at an angle running around a track or on the end of a long solid
arm or something. Set that spinning and the aggregate
centripetal force plus Earth’s gravity could be 15 meters per
second per second.
Why would someone make a huge centrifuge with hospital
beds and a lab in it? I don’t know. Would it even be possible?
How big would that radius have to be? And how fast would it
go?
I think I know how to find out. I need an accurate
accelerometer. Dropping things off a table and timing them is
all well and fine for rough estimates, but it’s only as accurate as
my reaction time on hitting the stopwatch. I need something
better. And only one thing will do the job: a small piece of
string.
I search the lab drawers.
After a few minutes, I have half the drawers open and have
found just about every form of lab supplies except string. I’m
about to give up when I finally find a spool of nylon thread.
“Yes!” I pull off a few feet of thread and cut it with my teeth.
I tie a loop on one end and tie the other end around the tape
measure. The tape measure will be playing the role of “dead
weight” in this experiment. Now I just need something to hang
it from.
I look above me at the hatch over my head. I climb up the
ladder (easier now than ever before) and put the loop over the
main latch handle. Then I let the tape measure’s weight pull the
string taut.
I have a pendulum.
Cool thing about pendulums: The time it takes for one to
swing forward and backward—the period—won’t change, no
matter how wide it swings. If it’s got a lot of energy, it’ll swing
farther and faster, but the period will still be the same. This is
what mechanical clocks take advantage of to keep time. That
period ends up being driven by two things, and two things only:
the length of the pendulum and gravity.
I pull the pendulum to one side. I release it and start the
timer. I count cycles as it sways back and forth. It’s not exciting.
I almost want to fall asleep, but I stay at it.
When I hit the ten-minute mark, the pendulum is barely
moving anymore, so I decide that’s long enough. Grand total:
346 full cycles in exactly ten minutes.
Onward to phase two.
I measure the distance from the hatch handle to the floor. It’s
just over two and a half meters. I go back downstairs to the
“bedroom.” Again, the ladder is no problem. I’m feeling so
much better now. That food really did the trick.
“What’s your name?” the computer asks.
I look down at my sheet toga. “I am the great philosopher
Pendulus!”
“Incorrect.”
I hang the pendulum on one of the robot hands near the
ceiling. I hope it’ll stay still for a while. I eyeball the distance
between the robot hand and the ceiling—I’ll call it a meter. My
pendulum is now four and a half meters lower than it was
before.
I repeat the experiment. Ten minutes on the stopwatch, and I
count the total cycles. The result: 346 cycles. Same as upstairs.
Golly.
Thing is, in a centrifuge, the farther you get from the center,
the higher the centripetal force will be. So if I were in a
centrifuge, the “gravity” down here would be higher than it was
upstairs. And it isn’t. At least, not enough to get a different
number of pendulum cycles.
But what if I’m in a really big centrifuge? One so huge that
the force difference between here and the lab is so small it
doesn’t change the number of cycles?
Let’s see…the formula for a pendulum…and the formula for
the force of a centrifuge…wait, I don’t have the actual force,
just a cycle count, so there’s a one-over-x factor involved…this
is actually a very instructive problem!
I have a pen, but no paper. That’s okay—I have a wall. After
a lot of “crazy prisoner scribbling on a wall”–type stuff, I have
my answer.
Let’s say I’m on Earth and in a centrifuge. That would mean
the centrifuge provides some of the force with the rest being
supplied by Earth. According to my math (and I showed all my
work!), that centrifuge would need a 700-meter radius (which is
almost half a mile) and would be spinning at 88 meters per
second—almost 200 miles per hour!
Hmm. I think mostly in metric when doing science stuff.
Interesting. Most scientists do, though, right? Even scientists
who grew up in America.
Anyway, that would be the largest centrifuge ever built…and
why would anyone build it? Plus, something like that would be
loud as heck. Whizzing through the air at 200 miles per hour?
At the very least there’d be some turbulence here and there, not
to mention a lot of wind noise. I don’t hear or feel anything like
that.
This is getting weird. Okay, what if I’m in space? There
wouldn’t be turbulence or wind resistance, but the centrifuge
would have to be bigger and faster because there’s no gravity to
help out.
More math, more graffiti on the wall. The radius would have
to be 1,280 meters—close to a mile. Nothing anywhere near
that big has ever been built for space.
So I’m not in a centrifuge. And I’m not on Earth.
Another planet? But there isn’t any planet, moon, or asteroid
in the solar system that has this much gravity. Earth is the
largest solid object in the whole system. Sure, the gas giants are
bigger, but unless I’m in a balloon floating around the winds of
Jupiter, there’s just nowhere I could go to experience this force.
How do I know all that space stuff? I just know it. It feels like
second nature—information I use all the time. Maybe I’m an
astronomer or a planetary scientist. Maybe I work for NASA or
ESA or—

I met Marissa every Thursday night for steak and beer at
Murphy’s on Gough Street. Always at six .., and because the
staff knew us, always at the same table.
We’d met almost twenty years ago in grad school. She dated
my then-roommate. Their relationship (like most in grad school)
was a train wreck and they broke up within three months. But
she and I ended up becoming good friends.
When the host saw me, he smiled and jerked his thumb
toward the usual table. I made my way through the kitschy décor
to Marissa. She had a couple of empty lowball glasses in front
of her and a full one in her hand. Apparently, she’d gotten
started early.
“Pre-gaming, eh?” I said, sitting down.
She looked down and fidgeted with her glass.
“Hey, what’s wrong?”
She took a sip of whiskey. “Rough day at work.”
I signaled the waiter. He nodded and didn’t even come over.
He knew I wanted a rib-eye, medium, mashed potatoes on the
side, and a pint of Guinness. Same thing I ordered every week.
“How rough could it be?” I asked. “Cushy government job
with the DOE. You probably get, what, twenty days off a year?
All you have to do is show up and you get paid, right?”
Again, no laugh. Nothing.
“Oh, come on!” I said. “Who pooped in your Rice Krispies?”
She sighed. “You know about the Petrova line?”
“Sure. Kind of an interesting mystery. My guess is solar
radiation. Venus doesn’t have a magnetic field, but positively
charged particles might be drawn there because it’s electrically
neutral—”
“No,” she said. “It’s something else. We don’t know exactly
what. But it’s something…else. But whatever. Let’s eat steak.”
I snorted. “Come on, Marissa, spill it. What the heck is wrong
with you?”
She mulled it over. “Why not? You’ll hear it from the
president in about twelve hours anyway.”
“The president?” I said. “Of the United States?”
She took another gulp of whiskey. “Have you heard of
Amaterasu? It’s a Japanese solar probe.”
“Sure,” I said. “JAXA has been getting some great data from
it. It’s really neat, actually. It’s in a solar orbit, about halfway
between Mercury and Venus. It has twenty different instruments
aboard that—”
“Yeah, I know. Whatever,” she said. “According to their data,
the sun’s output is decreasing.”
I shrugged. “So? Where are we in the solar cycle?”
She shook her head. “It’s not the eleven-year cycle. It’s
something else. JAXA accounted for the cycle. There’s still a
downward trend. They say the sun is 0.01 percent less bright
than it should be.”
“Okay, interesting. But hardly worth three whiskeys before
dinner.”
She pursed her lips. “That’s what I thought. But they’re saying
that value is increasing. And the rate of the increase is
increasing. It’s some sort of exponential loss that they caught
very, very early thanks to their probe’s incredibly sensitive
instruments.”
I leaned back in the booth. “I don’t know, Marissa. Spotting
an exponential progression that early seems really unlikely. But
okay, let’s say the JAXA scientists are right. Where’s the energy
going?”
“The Petrova line.”
“Huh?”
“JAXA took a good long look at the Petrova line and they say
it’s getting brighter at the same rate that the sun is getting
dimmer. Somehow or another, whatever it is, the Petrova line is
stealing energy from the sun.”
She pulled a sheaf of papers from her purse and put them on
the table. It looked like a bunch of graphs and charts. She
shuffled through them until she found the one she wanted, then
pushed it toward me.
The x-axis was labeled “time” and the y-axis was labeled
“luminosity loss.” The line was exponential, for sure.
“This can’t be right,” I said.
“It’s right,” she said. “The sun’s output will drop a full percent
over the next nine years. In twenty years that figure will be five
percent. This is bad. It’s really bad.”
I stared at the graph. “That would mean an ice age. Like…
right away. Instant ice age.”
“Yeah, at the very least. And crop failures, mass starvation…I
don’t even know what else.”
I shook my head. “How can there be a sudden change in the
sun? It’s a star, for cripes’ sake. Things just don’t happen this
fast for stars. Changes take millions of years, not dozens. Come
on, you know that.”
“No, I don’t know that. I used to know that. Now I only know
the sun’s dying,” she said. “I don’t know why and I don’t know
what we could do about it. But I know it’s dying.”
“How…” I furrowed my brow.
She downed the rest of her drink. “President addresses the
nation tomorrow morning. I think they’re coordinating with
other world leaders to all announce at the same time.”
The waiter dropped off my Guinness. “Here you go, sir. The
steaks should be out shortly.”
“I need another whiskey,” Marissa said.
“Make it two,” I added.
—
I blink. Another flash of memory.
Was it true? Or is that just a random memory of me talking
to someone who got sucked into a bogus doomsday theory?
No. It’s real. I’m terrified just thinking about it. And it’s not
just sudden terror. It’s a cozy, comfortable terror with a
permanent seat at the table. I’ve felt it for a long time.
This is real. The sun is dying. And I’m tangled up in it. Not
just as a fellow citizen of Earth who will die with everyone else
—I’m actively involved. There’s a sense of responsibility there.
I still don’t remember my own name, but I remember random
bits of information about the Petrova problem. They call it the
Petrova problem. I just remembered that.
My subconscious has priorities. And it’s desperately telling
me about this. I think my job is to solve the Petrova problem.
…in a small lab, wearing a bedsheet toga, with no idea who I
am, and no help other than a mindless computer and two
mummified roommates.
My vision blurs. I wipe my eyes. Tears. I can’t…I can’t
remember their names. But…they were my friends. My
comrades.
Only now do I realize I’ve been facing away from them the
whole time. I’ve done everything I can to keep them out of my
line of sight. Scrawling on the wall like a madman with the
corpses of people I cared about right behind me.
But now the distraction is over. I turn to look at them.
I sob. It comes without warning. I remember bits and pieces
all in a rush. She was funny—always quick with a joke. He was
professional and with nerves of steel. I think he was military and
he was definitely our leader.
I fall to the floor and put my head in my hands. I can’t hold
anything back. I cry like a child. We were a lot more than
friends. And “team” isn’t the right word either. It’s stronger than
that. It’s…
It’s on the tip of my tongue…
Finally, the word slides into my conscious mind. It had to
wait until I wasn’t looking to sneak in.
Crew. We were a crew. And I’m all that’s left.
This is a spacecraft. I know that now. I don’t know how it has
gravity but it’s a spaceship.
Things start to fall into place. We weren’t sick. We were in
suspended animation.
But these beds aren’t magical “freeze chambers” like in the
movies. There’s no special technology at play here. I think we
were in medically induced comas. Feeding tubes, IVs, constant
medical care. Everything a body needs. Those arms probably
changed sheets, kept us rotated to prevent bedsores, and did all
the other things ICU nurses would normally do.
And we were kept fit. Electrodes all over our bodies to
stimulate muscle movement. Lots of exercise.
But in the end, comas are dangerous. Extremely dangerous.
Only I survived, and my brain is a pile of mush.
I walk over to the woman. I actually feel better, looking at
her. Maybe it’s a sense of closure, or maybe it’s just the
calmness that comes after a crying jag.
The mummy has no tubes attached. No monitoring
equipment at all. There’s a small hole in her leathery wrist.
That’s where the IV was when she died, I guess. So the hole
never healed.
The computer must have removed everything when she died.
Waste not, want not, I guess. No point in using resources on
dead people. More for the survivors.
More for me, in other words.
I take a deep breath and let it out. I have to be calm. I have to
think clearly. I remembered a lot just then—my crew, some
aspects of their personalities, that I’m on a spaceship (I’ll freak
out about that later). The point is I’m getting more memories
back, and they’re coming sort of when I want them instead of at
random intervals. I want to focus on that, but the sadness is just
so strong.
“Eat,” says the computer.
A panel in the center of the ceiling opens up, and a food tube
drops out. One of the robot arms catches it and places it on my
bed. The label reads  1— 2.
I’m not in the mood to eat, but my stomach growls as soon as
I see the tube. Whatever my mental state may be, my body has
needs.
I open the tube and squirt goop into my mouth.
I have to admit: It’s another incredible flavor sensation. I
think it’s chicken with hints of vegetable. There’s no texture, of
course—it’s basically baby food. And it’s a little thicker than my
earlier meal. It’s all about getting my digestive system used to
solid food again.
“Water?” I say between mouthfuls.
The ceiling panel opens again, this time with a metal cylinder.
An arm brings it to me. Text on the shiny container reads
 . I unscrew the top and, sure enough, there’s
water in there.
I take a sip. It’s room temperature and tastes flat. It’s probably
distilled and devoid of minerals. But water’s water.
I finish the rest of my meal. I haven’t had to use a bathroom
yet but I’ll need to eventually. I’d rather not go wee on the floor.
“Toilet?” I say.
A wall panel spins around to reveal a metal commode. It’s
just right there in the wall, like in a prison cell. I take a closer
look. It has buttons and stuff on it. I think there’s a vacuum pipe
in the bowl. And there’s no water. I think this might be a zero-g
toilet modified for use in gravity. Why do that?
“Okay, uh…dismiss toilet.”
The wall swivels around again. The toilet is gone.
All right. I’m well fed. I’m feeling a little better about things.
Food will do that.
I need to focus on some positives. I’m alive. Whatever killed
my friends, it didn’t kill me. I’m on a spaceship—I don’t know
the details, but I know I’m on a ship and it seems to be working
correctly.
And my mental state is improving. I’m sure of it.
I sit cross-legged on the floor. It’s time for a proactive step. I
close my eyes and let my mind wander. I want to remember
something—anything—on purpose. I don’t care what. But I
want to initiate it. Let’s see what I get.
I start with what makes me happy. I like science. I know it. I
got a thrill from all the little experiments I’ve been doing. And
I’m in space. So maybe I can think about space and science and
see what I get….
—
I pulled the piping-hot spaghetti TV dinner from the microwave
and hustled over to my couch. I peeled the plastic off the top to
let the steam escape.
I unmuted the TV and listened to the live feed. Several
coworkers and a few friends had invited me to watch this with
them, but I didn’t want to spend the whole evening answering
questions. I just wanted to watch in peace.
It was the most watched event in human history. More than
the moon landing. More than any World Cup Final. Every
network, streaming service, news website, and local TV affiliate
was showing the same thing: NASA’s live feed.
A reporter stood with an older man in the gallery of a flightcontrol room. Beyond them, men and women in blue shirts fixed
their attention on their terminals.
“This is Sandra Elias,” said the reporter. “I’m here at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. I’m here with
Dr. Browne, who is the head of Planetary Sciences for NASA.”
She turned to the scientist. “Doctor, what’s our status now?”
Browne cleared his throat. “We received confirmation about
ninety minutes ago that ArcLight successfully inserted into orbit
around Venus. Now we’re just waiting for that first batch of
data.”
It had been a heck of a year since the JAXA announcement
about the Petrova problem. But study after study confirmed
their findings. The clock was ticking and the world needed to
find out what was going on. So Project ArcLight was born.
The situation was terrifying, but the project itself was
awesome. My inner nerd couldn’t help but be excited.
ArcLight was the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever
built. The world needed answers and didn’t have time to
dillydally. Normally if you asked a space agency to send a probe
to Venus in under a year, they’d laugh in your face. But it’s
amazing what you can do with an unlimited budget. The United
States, European Union, Russia, China, India, and Japan all
helped cover costs.
“Tell us about going to Venus,” the reporter said. “What
makes it so hard?”
“The main problem is fuel,” said Browne. “There are specific
transfer windows when interplanetary travel takes the minimum
amount of fuel, but we were nowhere near an Earth-Venus
window. So we had to put a lot more fuel in orbit just to get
ArcLight there in the first place.”
“So it’s a case of bad timing, then?” the reporter asked.
“I don’t think there’s ever a good time for the sun to get
dimmer.”
“Good point. Please go on.”
“Venus moves very fast compared to Earth, which means
more fuel just to catch up. Even under ideal conditions, it
actually takes more fuel to get to Venus than it does to get to
Mars.”
“Amazing. Amazing. Now, Doctor, some people have asked,
‘Why bother with the planet? The Petrova line is huge, spanning
an arc from the sun to Venus. Why not somewhere between?’ ”
“Because the Petrova line is widest there—as wide as the
whole planet. And we can use the planet’s gravity to help us out.
ArcLight will actually orbit Venus twelve times while collecting
samples of whatever material the Petrova line is made of.”
“And what is that material, you think?”
“We have no idea,” said Browne. “No idea at all. But we
might have answers soon. Once ArcLight finishes this first orbit,
it should have enough material for its onboard analysis lab.”
“And what can we expect to learn tonight?”
“Not much. The onboard lab is pretty basic. Just a highmagnification microscope and an x-ray spectrometer. The real
mission here is sample return. It’ll be another three months for
ArcLight to come home with those samples. The lab is a backup
to get at least some data in case there’s a failure during the
return phase.”
“Good planning as always, Dr. Browne.”
“It’s what we do.”
A cheer erupted from behind the reporter.
“I’m hearing—” She paused to let the sound die down. “I’m
hearing that the first orbit is complete and the data is coming in
now….”
The main screen in the control room changed to a black-andwhite image. The picture was mostly gray, with black dots
scattered here and there.
“What are we looking at, Doctor?” said the reporter’s voice.
“This is from the internal microscope,” said Browne. “It’s
magnified ten thousand times. Those black dots are about ten
microns across.”
“Are those dots what we’ve been looking for?” she asked.
“We can’t be certain,” said Browne. “They could just be dust
particles. Any major gravity source like a planet will have a
cloud of dust surrounding—”
“What the fuck?!” came a voice in the background. Several
flight controllers gasped.
The reporter snickered. “High spirits here at JPL. We are
coming to you live, so we apologize for any—”
“Oh my God!” said Browne.
On the main screen, more images came through. One after
another. All nearly the same.
Nearly.
The reporter looked at the images on-screen. “Are those
particles…moving?”
The images, playing in succession, showed the black dots
deforming and shifting around within their environment.
The reporter cleared her throat and delivered what many
would call the understatement of the century: “They look a little
like microbes, wouldn’t you say?”
“Telemetry!” Dr. Browne called out. “Any shimmy in the
probe?”
“Already checked,” said someone. “No shimmy.”
“Is there a consistent direction of travel?” he asked.
“Something that could be explained by an external force?
Magnetic, maybe? Static electricity?”
The room fell silent.
“Anyone?!” said Browne.
I dropped my fork right into my spaghetti.
Is this actually alien life? Am I really that lucky?! To be alive
when humanity first discovers extraterrestrial life?!
Wow! I mean—the Petrova problem is still terrifying but…
wow! Aliens! This could be aliens! I couldn’t wait to talk about
this with the kids tomorrow—
—
“Angular anomaly,” the computer says.
“Darn it!” I say. “I was almost there! I almost remembered
myself!”
“Angular anomaly,” the computer repeats.
I unfold myself and get to my feet. In my limited interactions
with it, the computer seems to have some understanding of what
I say. Like Siri or Alexa. So I’ll talk to it like I’d talk to one of
them.
“Computer, what is an angular anomaly?”
“Angular anomaly: an object or body designated as critical is
not at the expected location angle by at least 0.01 radians.”
“What body is anomalous?”
“Angular anomaly.”
Not much help. I’m on a ship, so it must be a navigational
issue. That can’t be good. How would I even steer this thing? I
don’t see anything resembling spaceship controls—not that I
really know what those look like. But all I’ve discovered so far is
a “coma room” and a lab.
That other hatch in the lab—the one that leads farther up—
that must be important. This is like being in a video game.
Explore the area until you find a locked door, then look for the
key. But instead of searching bookshelves and garbage cans, I
have to search my mind. Because the “key” is my own name.
The computer’s not being unreasonable. If I can’t remember
my own name, I probably shouldn’t be allowed into delicate
areas of the ship.
I climb onto my bunk and lie on my back. I keep a wary eye
on the robot arms above, but they don’t move. I guess the
computer is satisfied that I’m self-sufficient for now.
I close my eyes and focus on that flash of memory. I can see
bits and pieces of it in my mind. Like looking at an old photo
that’s been damaged.
I’m in my house…no…apartment. I have an apartment. It’s
tidy, but small. There’s a picture of the San Francisco skyline on
one wall. Not useful. I already know I lived in San Francisco.
There’s a Lean Cuisine microwave meal on the coffee table in
front of me. Spaghetti. The heat still hasn’t equalized yet, so
there are pockets of nearly frozen noodles next to tonguemelting plasma. But I’m taking bites anyway. I must be hungry.
I’m watching NASA on TV; I see all that stuff from my
previous flash of memory. My first thought is…I’m elated!
Could it be extraterrestrial life? I can’t wait to tell the kids!
I have kids? This is a single man’s apartment with a single
man eating a single man’s meal. I don’t see anything feminine at
all. There’s nothing to suggest a woman in my life. Am I
divorced? Gay? Either way, there’s no sign that children live
here. No toys, no pictures of kids on the wall or mantel,
nothing. And the place is way too clean. Kids make a mess of
everything. Especially when they start chewing gum. They all go
through a gum phase—at least, a lot of them do—and they leave
it everywhere.
How do I know that?
I like kids. Huh. Just a feeling. But I like them. They’re cool.
They’re fun to hang out with.
So I’m a single man in my thirties, who lives alone in a small
apartment, I don’t have any kids, but I like kids a lot. I don’t like
where this is going…
A teacher! I’m a schoolteacher! I remember it now!
Oh, thank God. I’m a teacher.</p>
