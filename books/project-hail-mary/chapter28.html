  <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
  <p>It’s been three days since the Great Taumoeba Escape. I’ve
taken no chances.
I manually shut off all the fuel bays—completely segregating
each one from the fuel system. Then, one tank at a time, I
opened it, collected an Astrophage sample from the line, and
checked it in the microscope for Taumoeba contamination.
Thankfully, all nine tanks passed the test. I brought the spin
drives back online and I’m cruising along at 1.5 g’s again.
I cobble together a “Taumoeba alarm” to alert me if this
happens again. I should have done that in the first place, but
hindsight is 20/20.
It’s a slide of Astrophage—same as I used in the Taumoeba
farms—with a light on one side and a light sensor on the other.
The whole system is exposed to the open air of the lab. If
Taumoeba get ahold of that Astrophage, they’ll eat it, the slide
will turn clear, and the light sensor will start beeping. So far, no
beeping. The slide remains jet-black.
Now that things have calmed down and the problem is
contained, I can start asking the million-dollar question: How
did the Taumoeba get loose?
I put my hands on my hips and stare at the quarantine zone.
“Which one of you did this?” I say.
None of it makes sense. The farms worked for months
without any hint of a leak. The mini-farms are hermetically
sealed steel capsules.
Maybe some rogue Taumoeba was lurking on the ship since
the last outbreak—back at Adrian. Somehow it didn’t find any
Astrophage until just now?
No. From our experiments, Rocky and I learned that
Taumoeba can only last about a week without food before it
starves to death. And they’re not big on moderation. Either they
wildly breed and consume all Astrophage to be found, or they
aren’t present at all.
One of these containers must be leaking. I can’t just jettison
everything—I need these Taumoeba to save Earth—so what do
I do? I have to figure out which one is the problem.
I check each farm as best I can. Since they’re in bins, I can’t
operate any of the controls, but I don’t need to. They’re fully
automated. It’s a pretty simple system—Rocky tends to find
elegant solutions to complex problems. The farm monitors the
air temperature inside. If it drops below 96.415 degrees Celsius,
it means there’s no more Astrophage because the Taumoeba ate
it. So it pumps in a little more Astrophage. Simple as that. And
the system keeps track of how often it has to feed them. From
that it makes a very rough approximation of the Taumoeba
population inside. It adjusts the Astrophage feed rate as needed
to control that population and, of course, has a readout to tell us
the current state.
I check each farm’s readouts. Each one shows 96.415 degrees
Celsius with a population estimate of 10 million Taumoeba.
Exactly what they’re supposed to read.
“Hm,” I say.
The air pressure inside those farms is way lower than the
nitrogen pressure surrounding them. If any of those farms had a
leak, the nitrogen would get in and pretty soon the Taumoeba
would all die. But they haven’t. And it’s been three days.
The breeder farms aren’t leaking. It must be the mini-farms.
But how the heck does a microbe work its way through half a
centimeter of Eridian steel? Rocky knows what he’s doing, and
he knows all about Eridian steel. If it wasn’t good for holding
microbes in place, he’d know. They don’t have Taumoeba on
Erid, but they definitely have other microbes. This isn’t new to
them.
All of this leads me to something I would normally consider
impossible: Rocky made an engineering mistake.
He never makes mistakes. Not when it comes to creating
things. He’s one of the most talented engineers on his entire
planet! He couldn’t have messed up.
Could he?
I need definitive proof.
I make more Astrophage test slides. They’re super-handy for
Taumoeba detection and easy to make.
I start with the bin containing the two mini-farms—the ones
intended for George and Ringo. They certainly seem sealed.
They’re just capsule-shaped pieces of metal. All sorts of stuff
going on inside, but smooth Eridian steel on the outside.
I peel the duct tape off one corner of the box, pry up the lid,
and throw an Astrophage slide in, then reseal everything.
Experiment number one: Make sure I didn’t accidentally breed
up some Super-Taumoeba that can live in pure nitrogen.
Another fun fact I’ve learned: Once Taumoeba get ahold of
an Astrophage slide, it’ll be crystal clear in a couple of hours. So
I wait a couple of hours and the slide is still black. Okay, good.
No Super-Taumoeba.
I unseal the bin, open the lid, and let it air out for a minute.
Then I reseal it. The nitrogen content in there will be nominal
now. Way less than Taumoeba-82.5 needs to worry about. If
there’s a leak in those mini-farms, the slide will tell the tale.
One hour, no results. Two hours, no results.
I take a sample of the air inside the bin just to be sure. The
nitrogen level is nearly zero. So that’s not an issue.
I seal it up again and give it another hour. Nothing.
The mini-farms aren’t leaking. At least, the ones intended for
George and Ringo aren’t. Maybe the leak was in one of the
mini-farms I’ve already installed.
They’re just glued to the outsides of John and Paul. They’re
not protected by the beetle’s hull or anything. I repeat the
Taumoeba detection experiment with John and Paul’s bins.
I get the same result: no Taumoeba at all.
“Hm.”
Okay, time for the ultimate test. I remove John, Paul, and the
two uninstalled mini-farms from quarantine. I set them on the
lab table next to my Taumoeba alarm. I’m pretty sure they’re
clean. But if they aren’t, I want to know right away.
I turn my attention to the even less likely culprits: the breeder
farms.
If Taumoeba can’t escape Eridian steel, they definitely can’t
get through xenonite. One centimeter of that stuff can
effortlessly hold in Rocky’s 29 atmospheres of pressure! It’s
harder than diamond and also somehow not brittle.
But I need to be thorough. I repeat the Astrophage slide test
with all ten of the breeder farm bins. There’s no point in doing
them one at a time. I pipeline the whole process. Now all ten of
the farms are in sealed bins full of normal air and have an
Astrophage slide inside.
It’s been a long day. It’s a good time to take a break and sleep.
I’ll leave them overnight to see what happens. I bring bedding
up from the dormitory to the lab. If my Taumoeba-detector
alarm goes off, I want to be darn sure it wakes me up. I’m too
pooped to work up a louder solution. So I’ll just bring my ears
closer to the lab table and call it a night.
I drift off to sleep. It feels wrong to sleep without someone
watching.
—
I wake up about six hours later. “Coffee.”
But the nanny-arms are downstairs in the dormitory. So of
course I get no response.
“Oh, right…” I sit up and stretch.
I get up and shuffle over to the quarantine zone. Let’s see how
those Taumoeba farm tests are doing.
I check the first farm’s Astrophage slide. It’s completely clear.
So I move on to the next—
Wait. It’s clear?
“Uh…”
I’m still not 100 percent awake. I wipe my eyes and take
another look.
It’s still clear.
Taumoeba got to the slide. It got out of the breeder farm!
I spin to the Taumoeba alarm on the lab table. It’s not
beeping, but I run over to get a visual. The Astrophage slide in it
is still black.
I take a deep breath and let it out.
“Okay…” I say.
I return to the quarantine zone and check the other farms.
Every single one of them has a clear slide. The farms are
leaking. All of them are leaking. The mini-farms are fine.
They’re sitting on the lab table right next to the Taumoeba
alarm.
I rub the back of my neck.
I’ve found the problem, but I don’t understand it. Taumoeba
are getting out of the farms. But how? If there was a crack in
the xenonite, the overpressure of nitrogen would’ve gotten inside
and killed everything. All ten farms have happy, healthy
Taumoeba populations. So what gives?
I climb down to the dormitory and have breakfast. I stare at
the xenonite wall that once housed Rocky’s workshop. The wall
is still there, but with a hole cut in it where I’d requested. I’m
using the area mainly for storage.
I chew on a breakfast burrito, trying to ignore the fact that I’m
one meal closer to coma slurry. I stare at the hole. I imagine I’m
a Taumoeba. I’m millions of times larger than a nitrogen atom.
But I can get through a hole the nitrogen atom can’t. How? And
where did the hole come from?
I’m starting to get a bad feeling. A suspicion, really.
What if Taumoeba can, for lack of a better description, work
their way around the molecules of xenonite? What if there’s no
hole at all?
We tend to think of solid materials as magical barriers. But at
the molecular scale they’re not. They’re strands of molecules or
lattices of atoms or both. When you get down to the teeny, tiny
realm, solid objects are more like thick jungles than brick walls.
I can work my way through a jungle, no problem. I may have
to climb over bushes, weave around trees, and duck under
branches, but I can make it.
Imagine a thousand tennis-ball launchers at the edge of that
jungle aimed in random directions. How deep into the jungle
will the tennis balls get? Most of them won’t get past the first
few trees. Some may get lucky bounces and go a little deeper in.
Fewer still may get multiple lucky bounces. But pretty soon,
even the luckiest tennis ball runs out of energy.
You’d be hard-pressed to find any tennis balls 50 feet into
that jungle. Now, let’s say it’s a mile wide. I can make it to the
other side, but there’s just no chance a tennis ball can.
That’s the difference between Taumoeba and nitrogen. The
nitrogen is just moving in a line and bouncing off stuff like a
tennis ball. It’s inert. But Taumoeba is like me. It has stimulusresponse capabilities. It senses its environment and takes
directed action based on that sensory input. We already know it
can find Astrophage and move toward it. It definitely has senses.
But nitrogen atoms are ruled by entropy. They won’t “exert
effort” to do anything. I can walk uphill. But a tennis ball can
only roll so far before it rolls back down.
That all seems really weird. How could Taumoeba, from the
planet Adrian, know how to carefully navigate its way through
xenonite, a technological invention from the planet Erid? It does
not make sense.
Life-forms don’t evolve traits for no reason. Taumoeba lives
in the upper atmosphere. Why would it develop the ability to
work its way through dense molecular structures? What
evolutionary reason could there be to—
I drop my burrito.
I know the answer. I don’t want to admit it to myself. But I
know the answer.
—
I go back to the lab and perform a nerve-wracking experiment.
The experiment itself isn’t nerve-wracking. I’m just worried that
the results will be what I expect.
I still have Rocky’s AstroTorch. It’s the only thing on the ship
that can get hot enough to dissociate xenonite. There’s plenty of
xenonite to be had throughout the ship, thanks to Rocky’s tunnel
system. I cut into the dormitory divider wall. I can only cut a
little bit at a time, then I have to wait for life support to cool
things back down. The AstroTorch makes a lot of heat.
In the end, I have four rough circles, each a couple of inches
across.
Yes, inches. When I’m stressed out, I revert to imperial units.
It’s hard to be an American, okay?
I take them up to the lab and put together an experiment.
I smear some Astrophage on one of the circles and put
another circle on top of it. Astrophage sandwich. Delicious, but
only if you can get through the xenonite “bread.” I epoxy the
two halves together. I make another identical sandwich.
And then I make another two similar sandwiches, but instead
of xenonite, I use ordinary plastic discs that I cut from some
mill stock.
Okay. Four hermetically sealed Astrophage samples—two
with xenonite discs, two with plastic discs, all four of them
sealed with epoxy.
I get two clear, sealable containers and set them up on the lab
table. I put a xenonite sandwich and a plastic sandwich in each
container.
In the sample cabinet, I have a few metal vials full of natural
Taumoeba. The original stuff from Adrian, not the Taumoeba82.5 version. I set the vial in one of the containers, open it up,
and quickly seal the experiment. This is a very dangerous road
to go down, but at least I know how to contain a Taumoeba
outbreak if it happens. As long as I have nitrogen I’m okay.
I go to Breeder Tank One in the quarantine zone. I use a
syringe to get the Taumoeba-infected air from the bin, then
immediately flood the bin with nitrogen. I tape over the hole
made by the syringe.
Back to the lab table, I close up the other container and use
the syringe to inject the Taumoeba-82.5 in. Again, I seal that
hole with tape.
I rest my chin in my hands and peer into the two boxes.
“Okay, you sneaky little punks. Let’s see what you can do…”
It takes a couple of hours, but I finally see results. They’re
exactly what I expected and the opposite of what I’d hoped.
I shake my head. “Dang it.”
The xenonite-covered Astrophage in the Taumoeba-82.5
experiment is gone. The plastic-covered Astrophage remains
unchanged. Meanwhile in the other experiment, both
Astrophage samples are unharmed.
What that means: The “control” samples (the plastic discs)
prove Taumoeba can’t get through epoxy or plastic. But the
xenonite samples tell a different story. Taumoeba-82.5 can work
its way through xenonite, but natural Taumoeba can’t.
“I’m so stupid!” I smack myself on the head.
I thought I was oh so clever. All that time in the breeder
tanks. Generation after generation of Taumoeba. I used
evolution to my advantage, right? I made Taumoeba with
nitrogen resistance! I’m so awesome! Let me know when I can
pick up my Nobel Prize!
Ugh.
Yes, I made a strain of Taumoeba that could survive nitrogen.
But evolution doesn’t care what I want. And it doesn’t do just
one thing at a time. I bred up a bunch of Taumoeba that evolved
to survive…in xenonite breeder tanks.
Sure, it has nitrogen resistance. But evolution has a sneaky
way of working on a problem from every angle. So not only did
they gain resistance to nitrogen, they figured out how to hide
from nitrogen by sneaking into the xenonite itself! Why
wouldn’t they?
Xenonite is a complicated chain of proteins and chemicals I
have no hope of understanding. But I guess Taumoeba has a
way to worm its way in. There’s a nitrogen apocalypse going on
in the breeder farm. If you can get into the xenonite walls deep
enough that the nitrogen can’t reach, you get to survive!
Taumoeba can’t get through ordinary plastic. It can’t get
through epoxy resin. It can’t get through glass. It can’t get
through metal. I’m not even sure if it could get through a ziplock
bag. But thanks to me, Taumoeba-82.5 can get through
xenonite.
I took a life-form I knew nothing about and used technology I
didn’t understand to modify it. Of course there were unintended
consequences. It was stupidly arrogant of me to assume I could
predict everything.
I take a deep breath and let it out.
Okay, this isn’t the end of the world. In fact, it’s the opposite.
This Taumoeba can permeate xenonite. No problem. I’ll store it
in something else. It’s still nitrogen-resistant. It doesn’t need
xenonite to survive. I tested it thoroughly in my glass lab
equipment back when we first isolated the strain. It’ll still do its
thing on Venus and Threeworld. Everything’s fine.
I glance back at the breeder farms.
Yeah. Fine. I’ll make a big farm out of metal. It’s not hard. I
have a mill and all the raw materials I need. And God knows I
have time to spare. I’ll salvage the operational equipment from a
farm Rocky made. Only the casing is xenonite. Everything else
is metals and stuff. I don’t need to reinvent the wheel. I just
need to put it on a different car.
“Yeah,” I reassure myself. “Yeah, this is okay.”
I just need to make a box that can maintain a Venusian
atmosphere. All of the hard stuff is already done, thanks to
Rocky.
Rocky!
I feel a sudden surge of nausea. I have to sit on the floor and
put my head between my legs. Rocky has the same strain of
Taumoeba aboard his ship. It’s stored in xenonite farms like
mine.
All critical bulkheads of his ship, including the fuel tanks, are
made of xenonite. There’s nothing standing between his
Taumoeba and his fuel.
“Oh…God…”</p>
